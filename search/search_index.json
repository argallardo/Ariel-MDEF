Analysis of my development \u00b6 Roles of prototyping: previous experience \u00b6 When I was studying engineering, the most typical prototype I used was Role 1, related to testing different aspects or functions of my projects.

It was a very extensive prototyping process, because we tested the dimensions, the materials, the technology and the physical exercises. Also, when I was in the \u201cVisual Thinking\u201d course, we were challenged to represent our conclusions after researching with public data. Role number 3. I investigated the relationship between quality of life and travel time from home to work. In that project I tried to represent inequality in Chile, because people who live in poor neighborhoods take longer time to go to work, while people who live in rich neighborhoods take a minimum time to go to work. I represented that with different tubes (printed in 3D), each one represented a neighborhood, and they moved towards the center at different speeds (with an engine and Arduino). The tubes representing the rich neighborhoods were faster than those representing the poor. Roles of prototyping: new opportunities \u00b6 My fight is to connect different perspectives, points of view or expectations, and create a new system, product or service. With this objective, role number 4, the prototyping process as a consultation vehicle, is very important, because if I want a good creation I have to worry about the process, and not just the final product/service.

In this sense, the process is a very relevant part of the construction, so it must be permanently documented, analyzed and criticized. On the other hand, the conclusions obtained through a collective construction are not always correct. The product/service generated must be prototyped to ensure its effectiveness, that it serves for the change that is to be achieved.

Along with that, the classes include field visits, where we could learn about the work in this matter from the space where it is created. In addition, each class had a series of exercises and experiments that helped us to apply and, and know physically the different theoretical learnings that we had. For me, the experiment of making our own bioplastics was key to my learning. We carried out all the experiments in the same group and in general, at the beginning it was difficult for us to understand what to do and how to do it, mainly because all of us years ago were not familiar with this type of activity and we were not able to understand what we were doing. Over time we learned that our best strategy was to stop and think before we started mixing and executing actions. That\u2019s what we did with the bioplastic preparation, which worked quite well for us as it was the right consistency and met the key criteria we needed to achieve. It was a pleasant experience of teamwork and execution. On the other hand, the experiment itself seemed very interesting to me, since it allowed us to verify live that we are capable of making bioplastic, in a simple and methodical way, which opens the possibility for our projects to consider this variant, without seeing it as a extreme difficulty or that makes our project much more complicated. At the same time, it brings us closer to a production that is friendlier to the environment, since since they are not derived from petroleum (like plastics), they can biodegrade more easily. Cultured meat phenomenon \u00b6 The food crisis, animal-borne diseases, the climate crisis and increased environmental conscience have led scientists to improve food productivity and yields using technology. In this way, different ventures focused on this market have been born, which seek through science to generate meat for consumption without sacrificing any animal. There are two types, one that is carried out through cell culture of animal cells and another that seeks to replicate animal proteins through other foods, such as mushrooms, legumes and other vegetables. Figure 1 outlines in a simple way the process of cultured meat, which, as established by Faustman (2020), is not technically meat, since it corresponds to cultured muscle tissue, since it derives from muscle cells, and corresponds to a post-mortem biochemical product. . On the other hand, genetic engineering has made it possible to create completely acellular meats, and therefore, 100% free of any animal origin, since it uses different protein architectures, which, when modified, allow animal replication. The challenge of both technologies, as established by the news and the different papers, is to replicate the characteristics of the meat, managing to replicate the taste, smell, colors and textures in the most perfect way possible. To achieve this, a high investment in technology is required and also, as stable XX, more legislation is required to establish regulatory frameworks to stimulate this type of research. Reflection associated with the course \u00b6 This case reflects part of what the course tried to convey to us, since they taught us about the structure of proteins and how they could be modified through genetic and scientific processes, and thus be more sustainable and efficient with the use of the resources. In turn, this allows linking a vision regarding the transformation that we would like to carry out in the world, together with scientific development, moving the barrier of knowledge hand in hand with a positive impact. Now, a criticism that can be made is that this is a reactive solution, since it does not seek to change eating habits, but instead seeks to replace products. Probably, as is the case now, this type of cultured meat will also be inaccessible to people with fewer resources and will even cause people to consume even more meat, without considering dietary limitations or the benefit of these actions.

Every emotion is a cone and it has a support network like friends, family, boyfriend/girlfriend associates behind, as a way to remind yourself that you are not alone and that you can activate them. If you are feeling more than one emotion, you can only put cones together! How will they live together? For a day I will have Inside out with me and every hour I will record my emotions What were you thinking? Many times we are closed in our emotions and we don\u2019t know what we are feeling. How can we change/solve/learn about something if we are not able to recognize it? On the other hand, if you are happy or scared, you can share it with your friends/family/pets, you are not alone. Why does that matter? Human emotions are reflected in interpersonal relationships, if you cultivate these networks you will be building solid relationships with others, that way you can feel accompanied regardless of what you are feeling. Experience \u00b6 My fight is to connect different point of views and design new ways of understanding problems and solutions, as a strategy to build strong societies and better \u201ccommon worlds\u201d. My personal work experience and the reality of my country have guided my motivation. I would like to change the way I recognized and measured the impacts of industry on environment and the lives of communities near such business. Change is not easy, because many times we must change our habits, and our quality of life, because we have to get out of our comfort zone. What is the cost of changing our habits? How do I feel when I have to change my routine because it would be better for the community, but maybe worse for me, because it is not my preference? When I arrived in BCN, I wanted to lead a more active life. I said to myself \u201cI\u2019m going to go to the university by bike\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m going to walk all the time\u201d, but the reality is very different. Actually when I have to go to the university or to another neighborhood I always use public transport, I have rarely walked, for me using public transport is more comfortable and it is my preference. \u2022 What did you make? Why did it matter? With all of this thing on mind I challenged me walking each time I should to go to any place. It\u2019s my way to be more close to \u201cmy new me\u201d and a way to analyze how I feeling when I should changing my routine and take a different decision that is better for me. My goal was registered my feelings after a long walk, my time travel and distance, and then compare this with my previous situation. \u2022 What happens when you involve yourself? When I started the challenge, not only did it change the way I moved from one place to another, but also part of my day: my lunch schedule, my available time to relax, my time to meet with friends. All of that influenced my mood, for example when I wanted to get home as fast as possible, I could not take the most efficient route because I could only walking. This allowed me to realize that decisions can actually influence a lot other dimensions, so you have to be as aware as possible of the consequences that a decision (like just walking) can have. \u2022 What happens when you use yourself as an instrument? I started to become aware of things that I didn\u2019t realize before when I was walking. Two important elements I became aware of is how my feeling of security varied depending on the time of day and the neighborhood I was in. Similarly, one day when I went jogging in my neighborhood I noticed the low female presence and questioned how it could be a different experience to do sports in public for a woman than for a man, and the need to design with a gender perspective, especially in Latin American countries. This kind of things has probably always happened, but I had not even seen it. \u2022 Did anything change about your way of working? The biggest change was associated with being constantly critical about what I am doing. Many times I just execute tasks and try to fulfill the expected objectives, but I do a very basic exercise of assimilation of learning. Many times learning is not merely theoretical, but has to do with sensitivities, emotional experiences, urban experiences, among others. Recording and monitoring is a relevant element to recognize opportunities and spaces for action or changes. \u2022 What does it mean for your future work?

For a day I will have Inside out with me and every hour I will record my emotions What were you thinking? Many times we are closed in our emotions and we don\u2019t know what we are feeling. How can we change/solve/learn about something if we are not able to recognize it? On the other hand, if you are happy or scared, you can share it with your friends/family/pets, you are not alone. Why does that matter? Human emotions are reflected in interpersonal relationships, if you cultivate these networks you will be building solid relationships with others, that way you can feel accompanied regardless of what you are feeling.","title":"Make a companion"},{"location":"term1/04-Living%20With%20Your%20Own%20Ideas/#experience","text":"My fight is to connect different point of views and design new ways of understanding problems and solutions, as a strategy to build strong societies and better \u201ccommon worlds\u201d. My personal work experience and the reality of my country have guided my motivation. I would like to change the way I recognized and measured the impacts of industry on environment and the lives of communities near such business. Change is not easy, because many times we must change our habits, and our quality of life, because we have to get out of our comfort zone. What is the cost of changing our habits? How do I feel when I have to change my routine because it would be better for the community, but maybe worse for me, because it is not my preference? When I arrived in BCN, I wanted to lead a more active life. I said to myself \u201cI\u2019m going to go to the university by bike\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m going to walk all the time\u201d, but the reality is very different. Actually when I have to go to the university or to another neighborhood I always use public transport, I have rarely walked, for me using public transport is more comfortable and it is my preference. \u2022 What did you make? Why did it matter? With all of this thing on mind I challenged me walking each time I should to go to any place. It\u2019s my way to be more close to \u201cmy new me\u201d and a way to analyze how I feeling when I should changing my routine and take a different decision that is better for me. My goal was registered my feelings after a long walk, my time travel and distance, and then compare this with my previous situation. \u2022 What happens when you involve yourself? When I started the challenge, not only did it change the way I moved from one place to another, but also part of my day: my lunch schedule, my available time to relax, my time to meet with friends. All of that influenced my mood, for example when I wanted to get home as fast as possible, I could not take the most efficient route because I could only walking. This allowed me to realize that decisions can actually influence a lot other dimensions, so you have to be as aware as possible of the consequences that a decision (like just walking) can have. \u2022 What happens when you use yourself as an instrument? I started to become aware of things that I didn\u2019t realize before when I was walking. Two important elements I became aware of is how my feeling of security varied depending on the time of day and the neighborhood I was in. Similarly, one day when I went jogging in my neighborhood I noticed the low female presence and questioned how it could be a different experience to do sports in public for a woman than for a man, and the need to design with a gender perspective, especially in Latin American countries. This kind of things has probably always happened, but I had not even seen it. \u2022 Did anything change about your way of working? The biggest change was associated with being constantly critical about what I am doing. Many times I just execute tasks and try to fulfill the expected objectives, but I do a very basic exercise of assimilation of learning. Many times learning is not merely theoretical, but has to do with sensitivities, emotional experiences, urban experiences, among others. Recording and monitoring is a relevant element to recognize opportunities and spaces for action or changes. \u2022 What does it mean for your future work? For my future work the creation process is also a learning process, so it is relevant not only to pay attention to the final product, but also to everything that was involved, including my personal experience, which can be an input for future improvements. On the other hand, I realized through the exercise the need to consider profiles different from mine in order to have a correct appreciation of the problem, because my experience walking around of Barcelona can be very different from a woman\u2019s or a child\u2019s, so testing is a very important part of the process. \u2022 After seeing the videos of your design space collective, how does it change your understanding of it, present new opportunities or inspire new possibilities for collaboration?

I have had similar reverse engineering experiences and many times they did not go well. We started by choosing the biggest device, a printer with scanner and fax system. Our anxiety to start working made us not to listen to the instructions, and we plugged the printer and we could identify that the mechanical system to move the paper did not work. Just with that clue we started to disassemble the system, it was amazing! I was very impressed with all the systems inside, we had mechanical, power, electronics, years of engineering and study that allow us to have smarter, smaller printers with more functionality. It is very impressive how they match all the pieces, and how each piece is unique and probably not replaceable. The system with which the printer recreates documents and images by ejecting ink through small holes at a very precise speed, location and volume, amazed me. Many people should think that the way a printer puts an image on paper is magic, and understanding how it works is a big step. I also learned about the printer business, many times companies put chips inside the ink cartridges, and that way you can only use their products. Finally, it is revealing the low price for a printer that is actually very complex and has so many things, may be the reason about the excessive amount of plastic parts. More reflections in our Forensic Report https://hackmd.io/IFpmoizIRRygTzq2N4Cxwg?both We started the second week feeling very smart, because even though it took us a long time to disassemble our machine, we had a lot of parts and systems to develop our own machine. However, it was very hard for us to coordinate our work and make decisions. We had a lot of uncertain, we didn\u2019t know what we could do and how to do it. We wasted a lot of time trying to experiment with different systems, different ideas, and we didn\u2019t have enough knowledge. It reminded me of my traumatic experience years ago, when I was in engineering school, because many times we were challenged to use arduino and other tools, but we didn\u2019t know how to use them. The difference in that case is the accompaniment of the IAAC teachers. Here the professors know how to work with arduino, and they are able to recognize when an idea can be complex. When we had problems coding or with electronic systems, they knew how to solve it, and if they didn\u2019t know, they knew how to find solutions. That made my experience not traumatic, unlike my previous experience. I learned that many times your ideas are limited by your capabilities, and the relevance of always taking into account time and other resources. If we had thought about it earlier, maybe we wouldn\u2019t have wasted so much time. Very late in the experience we were able to agree on a device, and then we defined the concept behind it.

I considering fundamental to include the non-human elements when we are designing, because today we\u2019re interacting with that kind of things all day. For example, social networks, apps and smart devices are part of our interactions, and it is neccesary to map, because they represent an alternative to change habits and patterns. The Obesity System Map exercise was eye-opening for me, as I was able to see in an exemplified way elements that can be mapped and that interact with people. This inspired me to make a small-scale map of my intervention: My intervention seeks to build a vision around the relationship with the environment from the vision of school students. Doing this exercise beforehand allowed me to recognize the limitation associated with schools: for example their curricular protocols, so to face this problem together with Jimena (classmate) we approached Xavi to talk to him so he could help us. Local Ecosystem Mapping \u00b6 From the roleplaying activity I learned a new way of being able to put yourself in someone else\u2019s shoes and get their perspective on a project.

Schools are ideal contexts since there are fewer distractions and there is supervision by teachers. Engagement and limits: Working with children is delicate, we must protect their rights and identities, so we will adhere to strict commitments regarding the use of information.

Design challenges: carry out an attractive and playful activity, since children at that age can be easily distracted. At the same time, being able to achieve the objective of collecting the visions they have can be complex, a poorly executed exercise can waste our opportunity and hinder all future work. Design opportunities: building collectively is always a good opportunity to materialize new insights. The greatest opportunity that exists is to generate a positive impact in different dimensions: literacy about caring of environment, proactivity, the maker spirit and the articulation of communities with the same objective.

This course has been a complete refresher on these issues. Many of the companies I have advised before have faced dilemmas similar to what we learned in the course. Increasingly the ethics behind new technologies and algorithms are a relevant point to study. I remember some new devices for shopping malls that could recognize people\u2019s faces and clothing styles, and in that way the store could plan its supply chain. In a nutshell, the controversy was: poor and rich dressed differently. If stores repeat this pattern, is it a way of reproducing stereotypes? The first week allowed me to understand what is going on behind AI and new technologies. It made me question how many devices hide deep dilemmas, which we need to talk about first. For the assignment we were challenged to think of a device of the future, we iterated on different alternatives, but we always encountered ethical issues, it was very difficult, because we had to be creative even though we could recognize that we were working on something that might be unethical. After our journey trying to define our idea, we chose a device that could detect sexist behavior in nightclubs, and if the device detects a dangerous situation, it will change the music, a way to control the environment.

I am also grateful that it made me aware of many things that happen around me, such as how eclipsed I was by my smartphone. The professor proposed interesting exercises to question our routine and be more mindful of what we are doing. Finally, I found the concept of degrowth very interesting. With the Colonizados Club (Latinos in the master\u2019s) we were discussing how many of the dimensions reviewed during the presentation could be reflected in our countries, and also how the first world often hides its impacts in countries like ours, which have all the externality of mining and production of raw materials. One day in 2052 \u00b6 My proposal was much more pessimistic than that of my peers. I was impressed that I did things much more down to earth, it showed that I am still not detached from my engineering mentality. I didn\u2019t think it\u2019s bad, but it still surprised me. Letter for the future \u00b6 Dear Ariel, I am writing to tell you about some of the most surprising changes you could imagine. The COVID 19 pandemic was an era changer around the world, many people, communities and countries began to mutate, changing their leadership, their governance systems and their expectations of success. Despite the various power struggles that emerged, over the years humanity faced one challenge as a whole, the climate crisis. For some, the lack of water, extreme temperatures and loss of biodiversity were a community alarm, the COVID 19 pandemic was like a preventive lesson, we all knew that this problem went beyond borders or ideologies. This is how society realized that the only way to prosper was united. On the other hand, the risk to our ecosystem made us finally understand that we were not the only species on this planet, so technologies advanced in a way that allowed us to monitor, safeguard and regenerate the environment. At some point we feared a world war for water, however, the knowledge distributed thanks to the internet and collaborative scientific work, allowed us to find a solution to the problem jointly among countries, thus avoiding competition for the resource. Today we have new challenges, such as deepening our link with nature, so that our impact does not mean further deterioration. How will it end? I do not know, as in previous historical moments there are dichotomous positions, however I have faith that we will solve it. Keep enjoying Barcelona, it will be your best years.

I am also grateful that it made me aware of many things that happen around me, such as how eclipsed I was by my smartphone. The professor proposed interesting exercises to question our routine and be more mindful of what we are doing. Finally, I found the concept of degrowth very interesting. With the Colonizados Club (Latinos in the master\u2019s) we were discussing how many of the dimensions reviewed during the presentation could be reflected in our countries, and also how the first world often hides its impacts in countries like ours, which have all the externality of mining and production of raw materials.","title":"Reflections"},{"location":"term2/01-Designing%20for%20the%20Next%20Billion%20Seconds/#one-day-in-2052","text":"My proposal was much more pessimistic than that of my peers.

The COVID 19 pandemic was an era changer around the world, many people, communities and countries began to mutate, changing their leadership, their governance systems and their expectations of success. Despite the various power struggles that emerged, over the years humanity faced one challenge as a whole, the climate crisis. For some, the lack of water, extreme temperatures and loss of biodiversity were a community alarm, the COVID 19 pandemic was like a preventive lesson, we all knew that this problem went beyond borders or ideologies. This is how society realized that the only way to prosper was united. On the other hand, the risk to our ecosystem made us finally understand that we were not the only species on this planet, so technologies advanced in a way that allowed us to monitor, safeguard and regenerate the environment. At some point we feared a world war for water, however, the knowledge distributed thanks to the internet and collaborative scientific work, allowed us to find a solution to the problem jointly among countries, thus avoiding competition for the resource. Today we have new challenges, such as deepening our link with nature, so that our impact does not mean further deterioration. How will it end? I do not know, as in previous historical moments there are dichotomous positions, however I have faith that we will solve it. Keep enjoying Barcelona, it will be your best years.","title":"Letter for the future"},{"location":"term2/01-Designing%20for%20the%20Next%20Billion%20Seconds/#time-capsule","text":"","title":"Time capsule"},{"location":"term2/02-Remixing%20Materials/","text":"Atlas of Weak Signals \u00b6 Materials research \u00b6 A new material \u00b6 We started the seminar knowling different types of materials and biomaterials.

Now is the most maker stage of the program, it is certainly something challenging for me, at first it did not seem so attractive, but after my experiences doing interventions I have discovered a taste for leaving the theory and move to action. I also believe that what is relevant for my personal objectives is to share the learning I have achieved through the master\u2019s degree with others, not in a unidirectional way, but by devising new workshops and methodologies so that people can also reach the same conclusion but in an autonomous way. During the presentation, we had an introduction about technology and how we interact with it. My studies in engineering have allowed me to be super close to the problems associated with understanding technology, so part of the reflections we had during the presentation made a lot of sense to me. At the same time, despite the danger of new digital tools, I think they are a great contribution to the work of the person. From a social point of view, and away from the master, I think we have to manage to channel these changes in the various areas of impact, such as labor, educational and productive. In this dimension, design has a lot to do and maker culture has even more to do, since it can reduce the gap through tools that are easier to understand. First challenge The first challenge was to operate a speaker through arduino. We had done this before with my group, so it didn\u2019t have to be that difficult. I managed to get it to operate with extremely basic connections, thanks to a youtube tutorial, however the sounds were quite limited. I felt provoked by the different tunes my classmates were making, so I asked them to help me do it too. The easiest was with Arduino Maker Uno, a different board that Wen had that she had used in a workshop with kids years ago. I followed the tutorial Marielle shared with me and we got to work. There was a very complete list of songs, which made the exercise quite entertaining. It reminded me of the ringtones I had on my cell phone when I was in elementary school. I wanted to find more modern songs so maybe I could go viral on my social networks, however I didn\u2019t find anything, the most updated was an Ed Sheeran song that we found with Wen and Jime, but the melody wasn\u2019t that similar either. Video: Week 1 - Class 2 - Parameterization \u00b6 This class reminded me a bit of what I learned in engineering, it was horrible flashbacks to Calculus 2 class, there I learned about graph and formula based parameterization, vectorization and linear algebra. I think because of this I in general it is easy to assimilate how the different tools work. It was funny that my answer to Edu\u2019s exercise of parameterizing a croissant was a wolfram alpha function, where it is parameterized through two functions and limiting their solution space, through functions. I think that the most striking and important part of the learning is how all that abstract and complex content that I learned in engineering, now could make sense, since what I parameterize can be made real through 3D printers. I am not unaware of the learning I had in engineering, however many times the exercises were not very applied and far from what I might ever need. With FabAcademy at least I can focus on learning while still doing things that are useful for my master\u2019s work. My croissant Parameterization exercise \u00b6 As part of the work, we have to try different tools and understand how they work. As part of the exercise I reviewed the different tools that we saw on the class: grasshopper, fusion, opencads, fusion 360, blender and stable diffusion. I found the concept of Generative Design very interesting, so I wanted to try Fusion360. All the tools were new to me, so any that I wanted would be a considerable time investment. I found out that my undergraduate university has an agreement with Fusion360, so I chose that software and started learning with this tutorial. Then, I searched the internet for available renders created by other people, I was impressed by the large number of renders of weapons, it is worrying the fanaticism of some people for this type of devices that seek to generate harm to other people. Guns Idea of the work and initial hypothesis: after my interventions in schools, I would like to use what I learned in fablab to design a game in which children can improve their literacy on issues of environmental awareness and protection, as well as develop their leadership as activists in their environments. Creative process: The first thing I did was to look for a rendering for the game, our idea is to make a game similar to \u201cLudo\u201d, the sketch I found was quite similar. My challenge was to design some of the game pieces. One of the findings of our workshop with the Sant Andreu School in Badalona, was the concern of the children about the trees in Barcelona, mainly because there are not many according to their point of view. For this reason one of the cards will be trees. I started by creating cones to represent each level of the tree, then I duplicated them and resized them to simulate a cone. Finally I made the trunk and a base. It seems simple, but it was not, however it is to be expected, whenever you start using a new tool, you have a time of assimilation, which is basically an investment of time. Creating cones Duplicate cones and sizes changed Tree without base Final tree Reflection about the process: - There is a lot of material available on the internet to learn autonomously. Tutorials are the best way to learn and it is an easy way to do it. - At the beginning it was difficult, but then it became more and more intuitive. I need a mouse, it is impossible to work with the mousepad of the mac. - There is a tremendous potential that can make my life easier, mainly because I don\u2019t like to work with physical tools, so designing through this way and then printing is something much more comfortable for me. Week 1 - Class 3 - Cutting on a laser machine \u00b6 Cutting on a laser machine and 3D printing are some of the most useful things in recent times. During college some friends of mine started selling different objects made with pieces made on a laser cutter: lamps, key chains and furniture. As part of the activity we had to use the laser cutting machine. Following our idea, my goal was to cut with the machine a figure of the possible game. The first thing I did was to consult in different repositories where I could find a tree vector and I found one that was quite useful for me, which simulated a Christmas tree. After learning well how the cutter works and finding out with my colleagues, I prepared the files to cut. tree in laser cutter I had everything ready to cut on Thursday, however I had to leave because I had a prior commitment. I scheduled a time to use the cutter on Tuesday. Week 1 - Class 4 - Input and output \u00b6 I think that human-machine interaction is one of the most interesting things we can learn in the master. As we learned in the seminar, there are different types of sensors. I was very interested in the ones that were associated with measurements of environmental elements. At the beginning I was very interested in what was being done with SmartCitizen, I wanted to use that technology in my project, but it could be very difficult, and probably I will need more time to do this, and with the time in class, tasks and personal work, it will be impossible. I was very interested in the monitoring of queality of air, because in my country, Chile, this is a huge problem. For my project, I think that sensors can help to guide the activities I want to do with the children, or generate visualizations that allow to understand first conclusions and trends. The challenge was to make a telegraph with arduino. I made the whole attempt, however, until Thursday I only managed to activate the lights with the button. It always happens to me with Arduino, that the simplest steps end up being very complex, generally for not following the instructions correctly. Everything related to electronics is a challenge, however I am very aware of how useful it can be for my project. Then Toni provided me with his code and arduino to test it on my computer and try to move forward, however my changes only made me go backwards in the progress. First Micro Challenge \u00b6 Working with Jimena and Wen is very comfortable, in general it is very easy for us to make decisions, which facilitates our work and allows us to move forward more quickly. The idea was different from the one I proposed, and we did not make a game, but a perception map, as a way to stimulate debate, the generation of new ideas and literacy on issues of climate crisis, mental health and gender equality. I think our idea is quite useful for facilitating discussion processes and team building activities. Sharing points of view helps us to make our own blind spots visible. Our structure based on: discussion of idea, planning and then execution was very useful to make the experience not so traumatic. Thanks to this activity I remembered how to use the laser cutter and imagine future uses for personal projects. Work with rhino designing the emoji tokens and cutting them on the machine. In the first iteration with cardboard Wen took the lead since she already knew how to use it and the second day with wood, Jimena and I made the cuts. my team The biggest difficulty was in the electronics, I was in charge of the board lights and because of a bad connection inside the board, our progress was stopped for a few hours. Much of the FabLab team was helping me with the problem, my led would light up when any object approached it, something much more complex than we needed. Then the problem was to connect all the pins to the arduino, the positive thing is that we were able to correct it fast. In the next steps I would like to involve more technology, I saw in Clodi and Mari\u2019s project the use of an application that they created and people could interact with their device and at the same time with cell phones, I think that is a tremendous development opportunity for us. Another improvement is to use sensors and lights to better guide the activity, for example as more people have an opinion the square could be illuminated or instead of having LEDs we could have a series of lights that change color according to the gradient. Things I learned: - Even though you are trying something very simple with Arduino, this can get complicated. You have to be neat and follow each step. - Using rhino and laser cutting. How to regulate each of the parameters to avoid burning the wood and affecting the aesthetics of our project. - The importance of documenting the process permanently and not at the end of the process. I learned this from Wen and Jime, both have this work methodology, which makes it much easier, since we can consult the steps and not lose focus on what we are doing. You can review our process in detail on this page: https://github.com/wenqianchua/microchallenge-01 Week 2 - Class 5 - 3D \u00b6 Eduardo taught us about 3D scanning and 3D printing techniques in a way to visualize new value propose for our personal projects. I have previously worked with 3D printing, however with very specific uses, without the opportunity to explore freely. The first exercise I did was scanning. With Marc\u2019s help the first thing I did was to scan myself, it didn\u2019t turn out so well, as the accuracy we had was not good. Later, what I did was to scan the Moai that is in the FabLab office, I found it a nice souvenir, because the Moai is a very characteristic element of Chile. To scan it I used a device that rotated the element I wanted to scan. All this made my scanning process easier, which allowed me to have a much more finished file. At my university in Chile I had been taught not to print in solid 3D, but only with a few layers, in a way to save material. Since I was exploring and the use of my Moai was nothing more than experimental, my project only considered 3 surface layers. After 2 hours, I got my Moai 3D printed. The satisfaction of creating and seeing a project materialize is fantastic, it makes me feel somehow like a craftsman. Week 2 - Class 6 - \u00b6 Today Victor taught us about the Internet and its role in the democratization of information and communication. No doubt it is necessary to make conscious use, since everything we do is recorded. This class was different, because unlike the previous ones, we were not left with an assignment, but rather applied learning during the class. This methodology is much more stimulating and less tedious than the other classes. I am very grateful to Victor. At the same time, the fact that we are all working together generates a much more rewarding collective learning dynamic. As part of the task we had to connect arduino to wifi and communicate among the different participants in the same space. I worked with Jimena, although Victor asked us to make groups, each one preferred to work on his computer in a way to learn and not leave the work alone to one person. At the beginning we had problems with the IP address, which had nothing to do with the code we were doing, so Victor worked on that until it was fixed. With the code working and after downloading the PubSubClient library, we created the channel called \u201cAriel\u201d. It was a profitable and successful learning process, I enjoyed it and I will keep in mind how to take advantage of it in the future. Week 2 - Class 7 - Interfaces \u00b6 In this class we learned to give new uses to MQTT servers, this time what we did was to synchronize all the arduinos in the class and coordinate them so that if someone activated the candle mode or flicker mode, all the lights would make those changes. Again I was pleasantly surprised with the class, mainly because I felt it was useful, since I learned in the moment and in a collaborative way. Week 3 - Class 8 \u00b6 Eduardo taught us how to use the CNC machine and opened up a world of possibilities associated with creating furniture. I spent a lot of time searching the internet for projects and ideas about what we could do. Edu told us that each person was assigned an amount of material, however we talked with my group and we all agreed that we could use the material for our group project and in this way not waste the material. Our idea is to make a table of an optimal size to be able to leave our perception map. We decided to CNC a box to store the different cards that we were going to use in our perception map. Working in CNC was much more complex than I expected, the machine was much more technical and had higher formatting requirements. We used a document we found on the internet and modified it to have the dimensions we needed. We had to sand a lot to get a better presentation, but there were still some marks on the wood. I learned that to work with CNC you have to be very careful with the parameterization. Challenge 2 \u00b6 For the second challenge we decided to create accessories for our perception map created in the first challenge. We made 3 new things: a card holder, the CNC case and a 3D microphone. I was surprised how well and fast we worked together with Jime and Wen. Each one was in charge of a specific area, which allowed us to advance in parallel in a much faster way. My task was to be in charge of the Arduino programming. I had fun playing with inputs and outputs, and looking for ways in which the technology made it easier to interact with our device. Some learnings: 1. Pre-planning is extremely important to avoid wasting time and wasting material. Spending time planning before acting allowed all of us to be clear about our objective from the beginning 2. Dividing responsibilities allowed us to move forward in parallel, but also to not over stress ourselves. Last challenge we suffered a lot more, and were not as satisfied with the delivery, now we were much more confident and could go further 3. Although it can be fun to use arduino and programming, it is important not to over-technologize or use technology just for the sake of using it, without questioning if it is really a contribution or not. We had many ideas, but we discarded some of them because they could be more distracting for the children. We had to be constantly balancing our imagination to avoid undermining the ultimate goal of our perception map 4. It is very important to be flexible, during the development we had to modify many things in order to be effective, for example we modified the interaction with the perception map and the usefulness of the microphone 5. Personally I learned that it is much easier to program and work with arduino in a stepwise way, that is, first start by making the basic tutorial, and when this works, move to a second stage with higher specifications. This way I was improving more and more the code, the outputs and the interaction between different inputs.

Another improvement is to use sensors and lights to better guide the activity, for example as more people have an opinion the square could be illuminated or instead of having LEDs we could have a series of lights that change color according to the gradient. Things I learned: - Even though you are trying something very simple with Arduino, this can get complicated. You have to be neat and follow each step. - Using rhino and laser cutting. How to regulate each of the parameters to avoid burning the wood and affecting the aesthetics of our project. - The importance of documenting the process permanently and not at the end of the process. I learned this from Wen and Jime, both have this work methodology, which makes it much easier, since we can consult the steps and not lose focus on what we are doing. You can review our process in detail on this page: https://github.com/wenqianchua/microchallenge-01","title":"First Micro Challenge"},{"location":"term2/03-Prototyping%20for%20Design/#week-2-class-5-3d","text":"Eduardo taught us about 3D scanning and 3D printing techniques in a way to visualize new value propose for our personal projects. I have previously worked with 3D printing, however with very specific uses, without the opportunity to explore freely. The first exercise I did was scanning. With Marc\u2019s help the first thing I did was to scan myself, it didn\u2019t turn out so well, as the accuracy we had was not good. Later, what I did was to scan the Moai that is in the FabLab office, I found it a nice souvenir, because the Moai is a very characteristic element of Chile. To scan it I used a device that rotated the element I wanted to scan. All this made my scanning process easier, which allowed me to have a much more finished file. At my university in Chile I had been taught not to print in solid 3D, but only with a few layers, in a way to save material. Since I was exploring and the use of my Moai was nothing more than experimental, my project only considered 3 surface layers. After 2 hours, I got my Moai 3D printed. The satisfaction of creating and seeing a project materialize is fantastic, it makes me feel somehow like a craftsman.","title":"Week 2 - Class 5 - 3D"},{"location":"term2/03-Prototyping%20for%20Design/#week-2-class-6-","text":"Today Victor taught us about the Internet and its role in the democratization of information and communication. No doubt it is necessary to make conscious use, since everything we do is recorded. This class was different, because unlike the previous ones, we were not left with an assignment, but rather applied learning during the class. This methodology is much more stimulating and less tedious than the other classes. I am very grateful to Victor. At the same time, the fact that we are all working together generates a much more rewarding collective learning dynamic. As part of the task we had to connect arduino to wifi and communicate among the different participants in the same space. I worked with Jimena, although Victor asked us to make groups, each one preferred to work on his computer in a way to learn and not leave the work alone to one person. At the beginning we had problems with the IP address, which had nothing to do with the code we were doing, so Victor worked on that until it was fixed. With the code working and after downloading the PubSubClient library, we created the channel called \u201cAriel\u201d. It was a profitable and successful learning process, I enjoyed it and I will keep in mind how to take advantage of it in the future.","title":"Week 2 - Class 6 -"},{"location":"term2/03-Prototyping%20for%20Design/#week-2-class-7-interfaces","text":"In this class we learned to give new uses to MQTT servers, this time what we did was to synchronize all the arduinos in the class and coordinate them so that if someone activated the candle mode or flicker mode, all the lights would make those changes.

I spent a lot of time searching the internet for projects and ideas about what we could do. Edu told us that each person was assigned an amount of material, however we talked with my group and we all agreed that we could use the material for our group project and in this way not waste the material. Our idea is to make a table of an optimal size to be able to leave our perception map. We decided to CNC a box to store the different cards that we were going to use in our perception map. Working in CNC was much more complex than I expected, the machine was much more technical and had higher formatting requirements. We used a document we found on the internet and modified it to have the dimensions we needed. We had to sand a lot to get a better presentation, but there were still some marks on the wood. I learned that to work with CNC you have to be very careful with the parameterization.","title":"Week 3 - Class 8"},{"location":"term2/03-Prototyping%20for%20Design/#challenge-2","text":"For the second challenge we decided to create accessories for our perception map created in the first challenge. We made 3 new things: a card holder, the CNC case and a 3D microphone. I was surprised how well and fast we worked together with Jime and Wen. Each one was in charge of a specific area, which allowed us to advance in parallel in a much faster way. My task was to be in charge of the Arduino programming. I had fun playing with inputs and outputs, and looking for ways in which the technology made it easier to interact with our device. Some learnings: 1. Pre-planning is extremely important to avoid wasting time and wasting material. Spending time planning before acting allowed all of us to be clear about our objective from the beginning 2. Dividing responsibilities allowed us to move forward in parallel, but also to not over stress ourselves. Last challenge we suffered a lot more, and were not as satisfied with the delivery, now we were much more confident and could go further 3. Although it can be fun to use arduino and programming, it is important not to over-technologize or use technology just for the sake of using it, without questioning if it is really a contribution or not. We had many ideas, but we discarded some of them because they could be more distracting for the children. We had to be constantly balancing our imagination to avoid undermining the ultimate goal of our perception map 4. It is very important to be flexible, during the development we had to modify many things in order to be effective, for example we modified the interaction with the perception map and the usefulness of the microphone 5. Personally I learned that it is much easier to program and work with arduino in a stepwise way, that is, first start by making the basic tutorial, and when this works, move to a second stage with higher specifications. This way I was improving more and more the code, the outputs and the interaction between different inputs.

Although we hear more and more about the importance of \u201csustainability,\u201d the reality is that there is no room for sustainability if we continue to do business as usual. Sustainability means \u201cpreserving, protecting and conserving current and future natural resources\u201d. So can we imagine a sustainable world? Kevin Slavin makes visible all that this current system means: rising temperatures, climate instability, species extinction. All this makes our world an unsustainable world. As the author states, the capitalist system has defined the frameworks in which production and economy develops around the world. Under this logic, we humans are the center of everything, where most of the natural resources are at our service. This is how we have used minerals, water, air, soil to achieve our economic and welfare objectives. Although some countries are increasingly moving away from this logic, there are still a large number of nations where the indiscriminate use of nature defines their financial and employability matrices. Abolishing this type of industry is not entirely simple, since if we want a more environmentally responsible development we require, for example, metals that allow us to make this transition. This is the case of copper and lithium, which are necessary for the construction of electric cars and ecological batteries. So we have the following dilemma: we need to stop environmental deterioration but at the same time we still require natural sources and the current system to solve this dilemma is not the solution. How can we do it? I believe that design is the answer. Through design we can create new materials, new ways of extraction and new palliative strategies for the negative effects of our development. We must move to a logic of regenerative design, that is, design that is capable of regenerating the damage that has been caused. Today it is not enough to neutralize the effects, but we must find a way for our actions to improve the initial conditions. It is the perspective of regenerative design that is best suited to address the challenges ahead. In turn, a perspective to leave behind is anthropocentrism and the \u201cuser-centered\u201d logic. Both elements respond to a capitalist logic that has deteriorated our environment and has made us lose sight of the full impact of our actions, reducing the success or objective purely to the approval or preference of consumers. To stop paying attention to this ideology will allow us to become aware of the environment that surrounds the products, services and experiences we design, without disregarding other actors in the context. Today more than ever, design must incorporate a point of view based on theories of networked actants, such as the one proposed by the author Bruno Latour. Without these elements design will be nothing more than the repetition of patterns that move away from real transformation. \u201cRather, they understand themselves to be participants, shaping the systems that interact with other forces, ideas, events and other designers\u201d(Patel and Moore, 2017). The power of today Today we have the opportunity to create new worlds through technology and the dozens of wastes we have generated throughout our history. The future of the world is associated with logics of reducing emissions, waste and new ways of building. Thanks to Chat GPT some of the worlds we can build thanks to technology are: 1. Sustainable buildings: designers can use various software tools to optimize the energy efficiency of buildings, such as energy simulation software, building information modeling (BIM) software and sustainable design tools. 2. Green cities: Urban planners can use GIS software and urban design tools to create sustainable and environmentally friendly cities. This includes designing green spaces, promoting alternative modes of transportation, and reducing the carbon footprint of buildings. 3. Renewable energy systems: Engineers can use simulation tools to design renewable energy systems, such as solar panels, wind turbines and geothermal systems. 4. Green products: Product designers can use sustainable design principles and tools to create green products that reduce waste and promote sustainability. 5. Sustainable agriculture: Agricultural scientists and farmers can use precision farming tools and soil sensors to optimize crop yields and reduce waste. 6. Circular economies: Economists and business leaders can use systems thinking tools to design circular economies that promote sustainable practices, reduce waste and foster a more sustainable future. This creative exercise allows us to visualize the potential of the different tools available to us and how through professional training we can refine techniques, innovate tools and manage environmental impacts differently. Transition The transition to these worlds must be carried out horizontally, that is to say, it must include technical and lay knowledge, under a strategy that allows the use of technological development hand in hand with local knowledge regarding environmental and cultural dimensions. Often, design and engineering approach challenges with an academic logic that does not address local concerns or realities, which causes products, services or experiences to be out of place. The transition should consider local empowerment in a way that the people themselves are active agents of a production with less impact, where concepts such as regenerative design are not encapsulated in contexts of technical expertise. The future considers the action of all agents in the system, recognizing themselves as mere participants in an environment in which they interact with non-human beings, which must be respected and protected. To achieve this, a series of definitions will be required to ensure the objective. According to what I have learned in Community Engagement and my experience working as a citizen engagement consultant, some important points are Define the concepts: a central element is to agree on what we understand by a regenerative world and what are the objectives we want to achieve. The different actors: local governments, companies, collectives and individuals will have specific objectives that must be realistic and measurable. Planning: planning allows mapping which tasks are necessary to achieve the objectives and coordinating each task as an understanding of the steps that will enable the new world. Areas of work: defining which are the priority areas of work, such as energy, food, waste, water or transportation, will allow to focus the work on those areas of greatest interest and impact. Engage stakeholders: a transition requires the participation of various stakeholders, so different levels of participation should be considered in order to respond to the needs of each stakeholder. For example: inform, ask questions, execute a partnership, collaborate. Evaluate: permanent monitoring of the work allows us to know how the different strategies applied are having an impact. This is important to be able to make modifications during the execution of the different plans. In this way, avoid generating undesired effects and direct resources in search of a more significant impact from a regenerative point of view. Co-create: Always consider the validation of people\u2019s opinion in a way that their voice is considered at all stages of execution. In turn, devise new ways to obtain feedback from stakeholders other than humans. Conclusion New worlds can be created if we stop thinking purely in terms of reducing negative impacts and move on to a logic oriented to the capacity of systems to generate positive effects on the environment. Metaphorically, the ideal would be for each actor to function as a large plant that consumes natural resources, but delivers others, allowing everything to continue functioning in a natural and friendly way. As a society we are tremendously challenged, because although we agree on where we should develop, we still cannot completely get rid of natural resources that are non-renewable. However, one thing we can change is the impact of the technologies or uses we make of these non-renewable resources. We must also be alert to opportunistic concepts that only seek to disguise the effect of industries on the environment. For example, terms such as sustainable mining, paper mills against forest fires, among others, are examples of organizations that want to reconceptualize their business under fashionable slogans, disturbing the understanding of citizens. This is why an informed and empowered society is required, since public and international organizations have not been able to stop this type of practices. Innovation and investment are critical to the transition to a sustainable world. Governments and businesses must invest in research and development of new technologies, products, and services that support sustainability. Without such efforts, all actions will be reduced to robust countries and communities with the capacity to generate efficient systems. However, those communities that are generally the most affected by the climate crisis and its consequences will be left behind. Without this understanding, the \u201cbackyard\u201d logic will continue, where leading countries care about their environment, but send their waste and impacts to other countries with fewer resources. Shifting society\u2019s mindset towards a more holistic and collaborative perspective is an advantage of regenerative design, as it values and respects biodiversity and natural resources. In addition, it can improve the quality of life of communities by providing healthier and more environmentally friendly solutions. This is why it is proposed as an alternative to build the new worlds we need as a society.","title":"Making Sense and Meaning"},{"location":"term2/05-Making%20Sense%20and%20Meaning/#making-sense-and-meaning","text":"Reconfigure systems Life as we know it can\u2019t go on much longer.

This, coupled with Marielle\u2019s comment about the privilege of doing such an activity, triggered a critical view of the methodology. Sometimes it is hard for me to understand and make peace with what 1PP proposes, as I come from a scientific and mathematical background, these new ways of understanding hypotheses, theories and experiments, escape my comprehension. I am grateful for the growth that MDEF has given me in that sense, since thanks to this \u201cmethodology\u201d I have been able to understand conclusions that emerge due to the experience itself, and not to calculations or in-depth social studies that can take years to generate a conclusion. This opens a huge door to be able to create new knowledge from personal perspectives, without trying to question academic or technical validity. Laura Forlano \u00b6 Laura\u2019s work reminded me of the statement of when innovation is valuable. Innovation is valuable (or is really innovation) when your hypothesis is not fulfilled, that is, when something happens that you did not expect. Many times when designing we lose perspective, and there is a barrier that we often can\u2019t jump, purely because we haven\u2019t experienced it first hand. When I was talking about disabilities and other communities, I remembered how I personally feel about feminism. Even though I \u201ccommune\u201d with feminism, I have a hard time calling myself a feminist, and I have a hard time seeing men as feminists, because we can never reach that empathy that comes from experiencing discrimination first hand. I am an ally, pro-feminist, but I would never be able to be part of a discussion or give an opinion, as I feel it is not my place as a man. Federico Van Amstel \u00b6 Before the master I had never heard about colonization in design environments. This talk and the master itself have been a constant learning experience, particularly in questioning and revaluing ancestral and indigenous knowledge. In Chile there is a great stigmatization and negative perception of indigenous peoples, generally associated with terrorism or responsible for the slow progress of the country. However, in reality what was happening was that we wanted to come with forestry, mining, industrial farms, and destroy their sacred territories. History belongs to those who write it, and as far as I have realized, it has never been written by the Chilean indigenous peoples. As a reflection I share Galeano\u2019s poem, \u201cLos nadie\u201d. The Nobodies Fleas dream of buying themselves a dog, and nobodies dream of escaping poverty: that one magical day good luck will suddenly rain down on them\u2013will rain down in buckets. But good luck doesn\u2019t rain down yesterday, today, tomorrow, or ever. Good luck doesn\u2019t even fall in a fine drizzle, no matter how hard the nobodies summon it, even if their left hand is tickling, or if they begin the new day with their right foot, or start the new year with a change of brooms. The nobodies: nobody\u2019s children, owners of nothing. The nobodies: the no ones, the nobodied, running like rabbits, dying through life, screwed every which way. Who are not, but could be Who don\u2019t speak languages, but dialects Who don\u2019t have religions, but superstitions Who don\u2019t create art, but handicrafts Who don\u2019t have culture, but folklore Who are not human beings, but human resources Who do not have faces, but arms Who do not have names, but numbers Who do not appear in the history of the world, but in the police blotter of the local paper The nobodies, who are not worth the bullet that kills them. Julia Ballesteros y Milena Ros\u00e9s \u00b6 Julia and Milena\u2019s work is inspiring because they propose how to approach design with new perspectives, much closer to the communities, who are the real protagonists of the devices or innovations that we can create. The perspective of alternative paths made me think about how I have chosen alternative paths. Mainly because I studied engineering and I have worked in the world of communications and now I am in a master\u2019s degree in design. Undoubtedly these types of interactions are extremely enriching, and these perspectives that we consider alternative, are actually a tremendous contribution to close many of our blind spots. Many times we design from points of view that we had before, and that is not knowledge, but in reality are prejudices, that if we do not face them with more culture and interaction, they are consolidated. Julia and Milena represent a vision of how we can, through the community, not be performative and advance in a design that does not seek to pass to carry the previous collective knowledge.","title":"Future Talks"},{"location":"term2/06-Future%20Talks/#future-talks","text":"","title":"Future Talks"},{"location":"term2/06-Future%20Talks/#andreu-desjardines","text":"This talk was interesting regarding how one is part of the study itself.

Many times when designing we lose perspective, and there is a barrier that we often can\u2019t jump, purely because we haven\u2019t experienced it first hand. When I was talking about disabilities and other communities, I remembered how I personally feel about feminism. Even though I \u201ccommune\u201d with feminism, I have a hard time calling myself a feminist, and I have a hard time seeing men as feminists, because we can never reach that empathy that comes from experiencing discrimination first hand. I am an ally, pro-feminist, but I would never be able to be part of a discussion or give an opinion, as I feel it is not my place as a man.","title":"Laura Forlano"},{"location":"term2/06-Future%20Talks/#federico-van-amstel","text":"Before the master I had never heard about colonization in design environments. This talk and the master itself have been a constant learning experience, particularly in questioning and revaluing ancestral and indigenous knowledge. In Chile there is a great stigmatization and negative perception of indigenous peoples, generally associated with terrorism or responsible for the slow progress of the country. However, in reality what was happening was that we wanted to come with forestry, mining, industrial farms, and destroy their sacred territories. History belongs to those who write it, and as far as I have realized, it has never been written by the Chilean indigenous peoples. As a reflection I share Galeano\u2019s poem, \u201cLos nadie\u201d. The Nobodies Fleas dream of buying themselves a dog, and nobodies dream of escaping poverty: that one magical day good luck will suddenly rain down on them\u2013will rain down in buckets. But good luck doesn\u2019t rain down yesterday, today, tomorrow, or ever. Good luck doesn\u2019t even fall in a fine drizzle, no matter how hard the nobodies summon it, even if their left hand is tickling, or if they begin the new day with their right foot, or start the new year with a change of brooms. The nobodies: nobody\u2019s children, owners of nothing. The nobodies: the no ones, the nobodied, running like rabbits, dying through life, screwed every which way.

The perspective of alternative paths made me think about how I have chosen alternative paths. Mainly because I studied engineering and I have worked in the world of communications and now I am in a master\u2019s degree in design. Undoubtedly these types of interactions are extremely enriching, and these perspectives that we consider alternative, are actually a tremendous contribution to close many of our blind spots. Many times we design from points of view that we had before, and that is not knowledge, but in reality are prejudices, that if we do not face them with more culture and interaction, they are consolidated. Julia and Milena represent a vision of how we can, through the community, not be performative and advance in a design that does not seek to pass to carry the previous collective knowledge.","title":"Julia Ballesteros y Milena Ros\u00e9s"},{"location":"term2/07-Measuring%20the%20world/","text":"Measuring the world \u00b6 This week was very motivating for me as we learned how data can inform and empower.

Personally, my experience as an engineer and public relations consultant, the systematization and conceptualization tools are extremely valuable, as it allows me to frame the problems and be able to decompose each of its parts. The attractive part of the approach we learned were the new dimensions associated with regenerative design and the concern for the installation of capabilities in users/communities, as a way to transmit and give potential to what we do (and be \u201cdistributed\u201d). Day 1 \u00b6 The first day we were confronted with the Mushroom Model, when the teachers presented it to us, the doubt that remained was how it could be applied to a service. Personally, I am not interested in working on product design, but more on services or experiences, so for the applied exercise I proposed to work on Chat GPT. Although it is still a kind of \u201cproduct\u201d since you can work on the UX/UI, you can also think of Chat GPT as an information system style service. Which skills did I need during the activity and how can I translate into something useful for me and my future? Since Chat GPT is not a physical product (beyond the web interface) I think the skill I needed the most was conceptualization, since we knew many things about how the tool works and its social consequences, but we didn\u2019t know how to typify them in a name. The dimensions of the model (making / power / value / knowledge) required us to be able to discern and categorize effectively. For example, recognizing the need to have good universities in order to have highly qualified IA professionals was a knowledge and making issue that we spent a long time trying to conceptualize, so that it would be consistent with our systematization. I think this will be very useful in the future, because more and more we are facing \u201cwicked problems\u201d where the problems and solutions we design are facing multidimensional issues, so knowing how to typify, conceptualize and classify them is the most effective way to manage and integrate them into the design. How was the dynamic inside the group? At the beginning I felt that what was most difficult was how to translate everything we knew about Chat GPT into a model that is easier to use for physical products. However, the dynamic started to flow much better when we started to disintegrate each of the topics that came to mind. I\u2019m not sure if we did a good job, but there were super enriching conversations, where we were able to locate all the controversies associated with Chat GPT. That despite showing itself as an \u201cOpen AI\u201d actually has a lot of barriers to entry for other people to develop something like this. I think I learned a lot from this experience. Did the role I played influence my opinion? My contribution was to mention dimensions associated with the economics and engineering operation of Chat GPT, taking advantage of my knowledge and professional experience, which was very useful because it opened up conversations regarding political power, technology gaps and potential ethical risks of the tool. This allowed me to add different perspectives from my colleagues, which materialized in what we wrote in the mushroom model. Day 2 \u00b6 The second day we worked on the Reflection Tree as a group with Wen and Jime, since we have the same project. The interesting thing was to submit our idea to a new board with dimensions that we had never questioned before, for example, everything that had to do with environmental regeneration. Environmental regeneration was our lowest point and something that we are going to integrate in our final product. It was a very good insight to be able to identify this improvement, as it gives us practical lights on where to go with our project. Which skills did I need during the activity and how can I translate into something useful for me and my future? Since the Reflection Tree canvas had many dimensions that we did not understand, we had to use our research and interpretation skills to be able to answer each of the dimensions. In turn, that interpretation had to be able to be located in the context of our project. We had to recognize what the blind spots were in our project and look for references on how to address them. I think there are two very useful things for the future, the first is the tool, since any tool that allows us to recognize our blind spots is extremely useful to strengthen our products and secondly learning to perform a good benchmark, because every time we set a challenge is extremely useful to know what is the state of the market / area as a way of not reinventing the wheel. How was the dynamic inside the group? The dynamics of working together with Jime and Wen are very good. We have been working together since the first quarter so we are already able to recognize each other\u2019s value and skills, so in general the whole order development works quite well. Did the role I played influence my opinion? Yes, listening to the feedback that the teachers gave us helped me to identify new dimensions in my project that I had not considered. As we were working in the field of social innovation, we had abandoned everything related to the environment. At the same time, Marc gave us ideas on how we could empower teachers to use our perception board, which was very accurate considering the objectives proposed by the methodologies associated with Distributed Design. Day 3 \u00b6 During day 3 we had to discuss about our values and make a group with those who shared the same value and analyze how we put it into practice in our projects. In a much more reflective way we were able to be able to capture what collaboration was for us. Which skills did I need during the activity and how can I translate into something useful for me and my future? I developed the soft skill of listening, since we had to address this discussion I took advantage of listening and being able to connect with the motivations of my colleagues. I had never worked with Ahmed, Caglar or Ramiro, so it was interesting to understand what they understood by collaboration in their particular contexts. What stands out the most is the inter-species collaboration, which was one of Ramiro\u2019s pillars, as it gave a new framing to something that we generally understand very much between humans (collaborating between people). How was the dynamic inside the group? I think the dynamics did not flow in a profitable way. Personally I found it difficult to approach teamwork. Used to working with Wen and Jime, who in general are more oriented to execution and application of methodologies, I came across a style of work that I did not understand and after a few minutes where nothing was being done, I took a ppt and started to execute an exercise where I could get the point of view of the others in a simpler way, since the conversation was not flowing. Did the role I played influence my opinion? Within the activity I contributed my point of view and a way of approaching the exercise, however I think it was not effective. I did not feel comfortable and at the time of presenting people noticed the lack of reflection and conversation we had. My positive thought is that at least we were able to propose something and break down a definition to build our own.","title":"Distributed Design"},{"location":"term3/01-Distributed%20Design/#distributed-design","text":"During the seminar I learned new methodologies and frameworks to approach a problem.

One of the most relevant things for me this week was learning about the existence of this tool. As Josep explained to us, the robotic arm has many uses that can make our lives easier. First of all, the precision it has allows us to assemble things, assemble microchips, position things in very specific spaces. At the same time, it has the strength to move and carry things, which allows us to surpass human capabilities. Finally, we went to the other IAAC site to use the robotic arm. I had the opportunity to control it, however I lacked much more confidence in my movements and more understanding of how to control speeds, angles and directions, as I did not meet the goal I wanted to achieve with the machine (go through the middle of an adhesive tape). Within the week\u2019s work we also used the parametric modeling tool Grasshoper. The truth is that I could not do much because my computer had no memory, but I could understand how the system behind the tool works. Seeing actions, functions and their specifications.

Week 2 - Blender \u00b6 In this class Victor introduced us to Blender. I think the most relevant thing was the critical point of view that Victor has about the software and the use we give to it. I think this kind of classes teach us much more than the tool itself, because due to the characteristics of the environment in which we have grown up, probably we have all learned to use a program independently, without the need of having to have a teacher, just a tutorial and knowing how to search the internet. However, the critical vision that Victor transmits allows us to question ourselves more about what we are doing, if what we are designing or assembling in a software is something we really wanted to do or we just let ourselves get carried away by the recommendations/limitations of the software. I think this is a very valuable learning that can be applied to many aspects of life. Week 3 - Interacciones humanas \u00b6 This week we used https://hydra.ojack.xyz/ to learn live coding. I think it is a tremendous tool to introduce the world of programming to kids or people who have never done it. It reminds me a lot of Google - Grasshopper, as once for a workshop with kids we used it and it worked very well, since as the kids programmed you could see the progress. I had fun playing, changing parameters and imagining possible uses of the tool in the context of Big Little Futures, the project we are running with the Badalona School. Week 4 - Blender + Python \u00b6 In this seminar we learned about Blender, its uses and the modifications we can achieve using python. Victor taught us how to \u201chack it\u201d which is very interesting because it opens a wide range of possibilities about what we can do. During the class we modeled the face of a monkey, making different changes to learn the functionalities of Blender. Challenge final \u00b6 During the final challenge we were asked to create an interface. For us it was difficult at first, because Santi and Victor wanted to know the reason for our proposal, which was complex to answer because the truth was that we were doing it only because they asked us to, but until that moment we did not find that it added value to what we were going to do in the MDEF Fest. After some more thought, what we made was a futures collector, which allowed us to collect with images the futures that the children were dreaming about. This way it was going to be much easier to generate conversations about that future and also stimulate creativity. From a technical point of view, much of what we did was achieved thanks to Chat GPT, I think as a group we learned the skill of how to be accurate in asking the IA and recognizing the potential benefits to improve our project. At the same time, through the queries we made to the platform, we were able to understand what it was doing. As next steps we want to be able to host the platform designed online, so that anyone can access it from their device. We also want that when the person chooses his or her future, it will be saved in a notebook, so that we can collect the futures of all the children in a simpler way.

For us it was difficult at first, because Santi and Victor wanted to know the reason for our proposal, which was complex to answer because the truth was that we were doing it only because they asked us to, but until that moment we did not find that it added value to what we were going to do in the MDEF Fest. After some more thought, what we made was a futures collector, which allowed us to collect with images the futures that the children were dreaming about. This way it was going to be much easier to generate conversations about that future and also stimulate creativity. From a technical point of view, much of what we did was achieved thanks to Chat GPT, I think as a group we learned the skill of how to be accurate in asking the IA and recognizing the potential benefits to improve our project. At the same time, through the queries we made to the platform, we were able to understand what it was doing. As next steps we want to be able to host the platform designed online, so that anyone can access it from their device. We also want that when the person chooses his or her future, it will be saved in a notebook, so that we can collect the futures of all the children in a simpler way.
