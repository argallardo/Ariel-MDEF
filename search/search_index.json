Personal development plan \u00b6 After sharing my fight and interests with my peers, I created my personal development plan, based on my previous experiences and my learning expectations. Analysis of my development \u00b6 Roles of prototyping: previous experience \u00b6 When I was studying engineering, the most typical prototype I used was Role 1, related to testing different aspects or functions of my projects. In 2017 I was doing the course \u201cResearch, Innovation and Entrepreneurship\u201d at the Faculty of Engineering, and my team and I developed a medical device to help \u201cclaw hands\u201d, a degenerative disease suffered by people with dementia and other types of ailments. It was a very extensive prototyping process, because we tested the dimensions, the materials, the technology and the physical exercises. Also, when I was in the \u201cVisual Thinking\u201d course, we were challenged to represent our conclusions after researching with public data. Role number 3. I investigated the relationship between quality of life and travel time from home to work. In that project I tried to represent inequality in Chile, because people who live in poor neighborhoods take longer time to go to work, while people who live in rich neighborhoods take a minimum time to go to work. I represented that with different tubes (printed in 3D), each one represented a neighborhood, and they moved towards the center at different speeds (with an engine and Arduino). The tubes representing the rich neighborhoods were faster than those representing the poor. Roles of prototyping: new opportunities \u00b6 My fight is to connect different perspectives, points of view or expectations, and create a new system, product or service. With this objective, role number 4, the prototyping process as a consultation vehicle, is very important, because if I want a good creation I have to worry about the process, and not just the final product/service.

I believe that this sentence can be explained with the same arguments used by the robotic arm in the text Prototypes and Prototyping in Design Research. \u201cBut the robotic arm example is also one where the contribution to knowledge can only occur through an iterative prototyping process: we cannot discover the principles or requirements for building a robotic arm without thinking about design possibilities. , propose, build, test, reconfigure, etc., an artifact that iteratively clarifies our understanding of this particular design space.\u201d Desired \u00b6 With this in mind, I would like to make an open and permanent iterative process, which is solid in the technical aspects, but which is open to the construction of the product/service from collective intelligence.

In this sense, the process is a very relevant part of the construction, so it must be permanently documented, analyzed and criticized. On the other hand, the conclusions obtained through a collective construction are not always correct. The product/service generated must be prototyped to ensure its effectiveness, that it serves for the change that is to be achieved.

Along with that, the classes include field visits, where we could learn about the work in this matter from the space where it is created. In addition, each class had a series of exercises and experiments that helped us to apply and, and know physically the different theoretical learnings that we had. For me, the experiment of making our own bioplastics was key to my learning. We carried out all the experiments in the same group and in general, at the beginning it was difficult for us to understand what to do and how to do it, mainly because all of us years ago were not familiar with this type of activity and we were not able to understand what we were doing. Over time we learned that our best strategy was to stop and think before we started mixing and executing actions. That\u2019s what we did with the bioplastic preparation, which worked quite well for us as it was the right consistency and met the key criteria we needed to achieve. It was a pleasant experience of teamwork and execution. On the other hand, the experiment itself seemed very interesting to me, since it allowed us to verify live that we are capable of making bioplastic, in a simple and methodical way, which opens the possibility for our projects to consider this variant, without seeing it as a extreme difficulty or that makes our project much more complicated. At the same time, it brings us closer to a production that is friendlier to the environment, since since they are not derived from petroleum (like plastics), they can biodegrade more easily. Cultured meat phenomenon \u00b6 The food crisis, animal-borne diseases, the climate crisis and increased environmental conscience have led scientists to improve food productivity and yields using technology. In this way, different ventures focused on this market have been born, which seek through science to generate meat for consumption without sacrificing any animal. There are two types, one that is carried out through cell culture of animal cells and another that seeks to replicate animal proteins through other foods, such as mushrooms, legumes and other vegetables. Figure 1 outlines in a simple way the process of cultured meat, which, as established by Faustman (2020), is not technically meat, since it corresponds to cultured muscle tissue, since it derives from muscle cells, and corresponds to a post-mortem biochemical product. . On the other hand, genetic engineering has made it possible to create completely acellular meats, and therefore, 100% free of any animal origin, since it uses different protein architectures, which, when modified, allow animal replication. The challenge of both technologies, as established by the news and the different papers, is to replicate the characteristics of the meat, managing to replicate the taste, smell, colors and textures in the most perfect way possible. To achieve this, a high investment in technology is required and also, as stable XX, more legislation is required to establish regulatory frameworks to stimulate this type of research. Reflection associated with the course \u00b6 This case reflects part of what the course tried to convey to us, since they taught us about the structure of proteins and how they could be modified through genetic and scientific processes, and thus be more sustainable and efficient with the use of the resources. In turn, this allows linking a vision regarding the transformation that we would like to carry out in the world, together with scientific development, moving the barrier of knowledge hand in hand with a positive impact. Now, a criticism that can be made is that this is a reactive solution, since it does not seek to change eating habits, but instead seeks to replace products. Probably, as is the case now, this type of cultured meat will also be inaccessible to people with fewer resources and will even cause people to consume even more meat, without considering dietary limitations or the benefit of these actions.

Every emotion is a cone and it has a support network like friends, family, boyfriend/girlfriend associates behind, as a way to remind yourself that you are not alone and that you can activate them. If you are feeling more than one emotion, you can only put cones together! How will they live together? For a day I will have Inside out with me and every hour I will record my emotions What were you thinking? Many times we are closed in our emotions and we don\u2019t know what we are feeling. How can we change/solve/learn about something if we are not able to recognize it? On the other hand, if you are happy or scared, you can share it with your friends/family/pets, you are not alone. Why does that matter? Human emotions are reflected in interpersonal relationships, if you cultivate these networks you will be building solid relationships with others, that way you can feel accompanied regardless of what you are feeling. Experience \u00b6 My fight is to connect different point of views and design new ways of understanding problems and solutions, as a strategy to build strong societies and better \u201ccommon worlds\u201d. My personal work experience and the reality of my country have guided my motivation. I would like to change the way I recognized and measured the impacts of industry on environment and the lives of communities near such business. Change is not easy, because many times we must change our habits, and our quality of life, because we have to get out of our comfort zone. What is the cost of changing our habits? How do I feel when I have to change my routine because it would be better for the community, but maybe worse for me, because it is not my preference? When I arrived in BCN, I wanted to lead a more active life. I said to myself \u201cI\u2019m going to go to the university by bike\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m going to walk all the time\u201d, but the reality is very different. Actually when I have to go to the university or to another neighborhood I always use public transport, I have rarely walked, for me using public transport is more comfortable and it is my preference. \u2022 What did you make? Why did it matter? With all of this thing on mind I challenged me walking each time I should to go to any place. It\u2019s my way to be more close to \u201cmy new me\u201d and a way to analyze how I feeling when I should changing my routine and take a different decision that is better for me. My goal was registered my feelings after a long walk, my time travel and distance, and then compare this with my previous situation. \u2022 What happens when you involve yourself? When I started the challenge, not only did it change the way I moved from one place to another, but also part of my day: my lunch schedule, my available time to relax, my time to meet with friends. All of that influenced my mood, for example when I wanted to get home as fast as possible, I could not take the most efficient route because I could only walking. This allowed me to realize that decisions can actually influence a lot other dimensions, so you have to be as aware as possible of the consequences that a decision (like just walking) can have. \u2022 What happens when you use yourself as an instrument? I started to become aware of things that I didn\u2019t realize before when I was walking. Two important elements I became aware of is how my feeling of security varied depending on the time of day and the neighborhood I was in. Similarly, one day when I went jogging in my neighborhood I noticed the low female presence and questioned how it could be a different experience to do sports in public for a woman than for a man, and the need to design with a gender perspective, especially in Latin American countries. This kind of things has probably always happened, but I had not even seen it. \u2022 Did anything change about your way of working? The biggest change was associated with being constantly critical about what I am doing. Many times I just execute tasks and try to fulfill the expected objectives, but I do a very basic exercise of assimilation of learning. Many times learning is not merely theoretical, but has to do with sensitivities, emotional experiences, urban experiences, among others. Recording and monitoring is a relevant element to recognize opportunities and spaces for action or changes. \u2022 What does it mean for your future work? For my future work the creation process is also a learning process, so it is relevant not only to pay attention to the final product, but also to everything that was involved, including my personal experience, which can be an input for future improvements. On the other hand, I realized through the exercise the need to consider profiles different from mine in order to have a correct appreciation of the problem, because my experience walking around of Barcelona can be very different from a woman\u2019s or a child\u2019s, so testing is a very important part of the process. \u2022 After seeing the videos of your design space collective, how does it change your understanding of it, present new opportunities or inspire new possibilities for collaboration? The work of my classmates was inspiring mainly because they all connected it with a personal motivation, which helps me to nourish myself with respect to different ideas and concepts to which I did not have access before. Mainly the challenges associated with the recording of feelings I found extremely important and revealing, and they also used instruments that were unknown to me until now, which expanded my tools to develop my master\u2019s project. On the other hand, some of them were extremely innovative in their recordings, both in what they measured and how they did it. This was inspiring, because it was a departure from the measurements traditionally made in my discipline, such as those I made of travel time and distance traveled.

For a day I will have Inside out with me and every hour I will record my emotions What were you thinking? Many times we are closed in our emotions and we don\u2019t know what we are feeling. How can we change/solve/learn about something if we are not able to recognize it? On the other hand, if you are happy or scared, you can share it with your friends/family/pets, you are not alone. Why does that matter? Human emotions are reflected in interpersonal relationships, if you cultivate these networks you will be building solid relationships with others, that way you can feel accompanied regardless of what you are feeling.","title":"Make a companion"},{"location":"term1/04-Living%20With%20Your%20Own%20Ideas/#experience","text":"My fight is to connect different point of views and design new ways of understanding problems and solutions, as a strategy to build strong societies and better \u201ccommon worlds\u201d. My personal work experience and the reality of my country have guided my motivation. I would like to change the way I recognized and measured the impacts of industry on environment and the lives of communities near such business. Change is not easy, because many times we must change our habits, and our quality of life, because we have to get out of our comfort zone. What is the cost of changing our habits? How do I feel when I have to change my routine because it would be better for the community, but maybe worse for me, because it is not my preference? When I arrived in BCN, I wanted to lead a more active life. I said to myself \u201cI\u2019m going to go to the university by bike\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m going to walk all the time\u201d, but the reality is very different. Actually when I have to go to the university or to another neighborhood I always use public transport, I have rarely walked, for me using public transport is more comfortable and it is my preference. \u2022 What did you make? Why did it matter? With all of this thing on mind I challenged me walking each time I should to go to any place. It\u2019s my way to be more close to \u201cmy new me\u201d and a way to analyze how I feeling when I should changing my routine and take a different decision that is better for me. My goal was registered my feelings after a long walk, my time travel and distance, and then compare this with my previous situation. \u2022 What happens when you involve yourself? When I started the challenge, not only did it change the way I moved from one place to another, but also part of my day: my lunch schedule, my available time to relax, my time to meet with friends. All of that influenced my mood, for example when I wanted to get home as fast as possible, I could not take the most efficient route because I could only walking. This allowed me to realize that decisions can actually influence a lot other dimensions, so you have to be as aware as possible of the consequences that a decision (like just walking) can have. \u2022 What happens when you use yourself as an instrument? I started to become aware of things that I didn\u2019t realize before when I was walking. Two important elements I became aware of is how my feeling of security varied depending on the time of day and the neighborhood I was in. Similarly, one day when I went jogging in my neighborhood I noticed the low female presence and questioned how it could be a different experience to do sports in public for a woman than for a man, and the need to design with a gender perspective, especially in Latin American countries. This kind of things has probably always happened, but I had not even seen it. \u2022 Did anything change about your way of working? The biggest change was associated with being constantly critical about what I am doing. Many times I just execute tasks and try to fulfill the expected objectives, but I do a very basic exercise of assimilation of learning. Many times learning is not merely theoretical, but has to do with sensitivities, emotional experiences, urban experiences, among others. Recording and monitoring is a relevant element to recognize opportunities and spaces for action or changes. \u2022 What does it mean for your future work? For my future work the creation process is also a learning process, so it is relevant not only to pay attention to the final product, but also to everything that was involved, including my personal experience, which can be an input for future improvements. On the other hand, I realized through the exercise the need to consider profiles different from mine in order to have a correct appreciation of the problem, because my experience walking around of Barcelona can be very different from a woman\u2019s or a child\u2019s, so testing is a very important part of the process. \u2022 After seeing the videos of your design space collective, how does it change your understanding of it, present new opportunities or inspire new possibilities for collaboration? The work of my classmates was inspiring mainly because they all connected it with a personal motivation, which helps me to nourish myself with respect to different ideas and concepts to which I did not have access before. Mainly the challenges associated with the recording of feelings I found extremely important and revealing, and they also used instruments that were unknown to me until now, which expanded my tools to develop my master\u2019s project. On the other hand, some of them were extremely innovative in their recordings, both in what they measured and how they did it. This was inspiring, because it was a departure from the measurements traditionally made in my discipline, such as those I made of travel time and distance traveled.

I have had similar reverse engineering experiences and many times they did not go well. We started by choosing the biggest device, a printer with scanner and fax system. Our anxiety to start working made us not to listen to the instructions, and we plugged the printer and we could identify that the mechanical system to move the paper did not work. Just with that clue we started to disassemble the system, it was amazing! I was very impressed with all the systems inside, we had mechanical, power, electronics, years of engineering and study that allow us to have smarter, smaller printers with more functionality. It is very impressive how they match all the pieces, and how each piece is unique and probably not replaceable. The system with which the printer recreates documents and images by ejecting ink through small holes at a very precise speed, location and volume, amazed me. Many people should think that the way a printer puts an image on paper is magic, and understanding how it works is a big step. I also learned about the printer business, many times companies put chips inside the ink cartridges, and that way you can only use their products. Finally, it is revealing the low price for a printer that is actually very complex and has so many things, may be the reason about the excessive amount of plastic parts. More reflections in our Forensic Report https://hackmd.io/IFpmoizIRRygTzq2N4Cxwg?both We started the second week feeling very smart, because even though it took us a long time to disassemble our machine, we had a lot of parts and systems to develop our own machine. However, it was very hard for us to coordinate our work and make decisions. We had a lot of uncertain, we didn\u2019t know what we could do and how to do it. We wasted a lot of time trying to experiment with different systems, different ideas, and we didn\u2019t have enough knowledge. It reminded me of my traumatic experience years ago, when I was in engineering school, because many times we were challenged to use arduino and other tools, but we didn\u2019t know how to use them. The difference in that case is the accompaniment of the IAAC teachers. Here the professors know how to work with arduino, and they are able to recognize when an idea can be complex. When we had problems coding or with electronic systems, they knew how to solve it, and if they didn\u2019t know, they knew how to find solutions. That made my experience not traumatic, unlike my previous experience. I learned that many times your ideas are limited by your capabilities, and the relevance of always taking into account time and other resources. If we had thought about it earlier, maybe we wouldn\u2019t have wasted so much time. Very late in the experience we were able to agree on a device, and then we defined the concept behind it. Even though everything worked and the framing between our narrative and our device was interesting, this came out in an improvised way, contrary to what methodologically needs to be done.

Among the elements that caught my attention was the approximation with Bruno Latour theory, about the relationship between human and non-human in a network. I considering fundamental to include the non-human elements when we are designing, because today we\u2019re interacting with that kind of things all day. For example, social networks, apps and smart devices are part of our interactions, and it is neccesary to map, because they represent an alternative to change habits and patterns. The Obesity System Map exercise was eye-opening for me, as I was able to see in an exemplified way elements that can be mapped and that interact with people. This inspired me to make a small-scale map of my intervention: My intervention seeks to build a vision around the relationship with the environment from the vision of school students. Doing this exercise beforehand allowed me to recognize the limitation associated with schools: for example their curricular protocols, so to face this problem together with Jimena (classmate) we approached Xavi to talk to him so he could help us. Local Ecosystem Mapping \u00b6 From the roleplaying activity I learned a new way of being able to put yourself in someone else\u2019s shoes and get their perspective on a project. The exercise stimulated to find points of agreement and points of controversy, so we were able to work on a \u201cwicked problem\u201d in an applied way, which was very interesting.

Context: Caring the environment is in general limited to recycling, but today people take care of their environment in a lot of different ways. My idea is working with 6-9 year old school children to understand their perception of climate change and caring of environment. Current situation: schools are very interested in participating in issues related to the environment. This is a good opportunity to generate scalable and deep work. Schools are ideal contexts since there are fewer distractions and there is supervision by teachers. Engagement and limits: Working with children is delicate, we must protect their rights and identities, so we will adhere to strict commitments regarding the use of information. At the same time, we will be concerned that our work does not deepen discrimination or eco-anxiety in children. Theory of change: We want to understand and design from the vision of the future that the children of Barcelona have. The future is mainly theirs, so we want to be a tool to materialize their desires. Personally I want to revalue and perfect different ways of caring for the environment, outside of the most obvious and traditional ways. Design challenges: carry out an attractive and playful activity, since children at that age can be easily distracted. At the same time, being able to achieve the objective of collecting the visions they have can be complex, a poorly executed exercise can waste our opportunity and hinder all future work. Design opportunities: building collectively is always a good opportunity to materialize new insights. The greatest opportunity that exists is to generate a positive impact in different dimensions: literacy about caring of environment, proactivity, the maker spirit and the articulation of communities with the same objective.

This course has been a complete refresher on these issues. Many of the companies I have advised before have faced dilemmas similar to what we learned in the course. Increasingly the ethics behind new technologies and algorithms are a relevant point to study. I remember some new devices for shopping malls that could recognize people\u2019s faces and clothing styles, and in that way the store could plan its supply chain. In a nutshell, the controversy was: poor and rich dressed differently. If stores repeat this pattern, is it a way of reproducing stereotypes? The first week allowed me to understand what is going on behind AI and new technologies. It made me question how many devices hide deep dilemmas, which we need to talk about first. For the assignment we were challenged to think of a device of the future, we iterated on different alternatives, but we always encountered ethical issues, it was very difficult, because we had to be creative even though we could recognize that we were working on something that might be unethical.

Letter for the future \u00b6 Dear Ariel, I am writing to tell you about some of the most surprising changes you could imagine. The COVID 19 pandemic was an era changer around the world, many people, communities and countries began to mutate, changing their leadership, their governance systems and their expectations of success. Despite the various power struggles that emerged, over the years humanity faced one challenge as a whole, the climate crisis. For some, the lack of water, extreme temperatures and loss of biodiversity were a community alarm, the COVID 19 pandemic was like a preventive lesson, we all knew that this problem went beyond borders or ideologies. This is how society realized that the only way to prosper was united. On the other hand, the risk to our ecosystem made us finally understand that we were not the only species on this planet, so technologies advanced in a way that allowed us to monitor, safeguard and regenerate the environment. At some point we feared a world war for water, however, the knowledge distributed thanks to the internet and collaborative scientific work, allowed us to find a solution to the problem jointly among countries, thus avoiding competition for the resource. Today we have new challenges, such as deepening our link with nature, so that our impact does not mean further deterioration. How will it end? I do not know, as in previous historical moments there are dichotomous positions, however I have faith that we will solve it. Keep enjoying Barcelona, it will be your best years.

On the other hand, the risk to our ecosystem made us finally understand that we were not the only species on this planet, so technologies advanced in a way that allowed us to monitor, safeguard and regenerate the environment. At some point we feared a world war for water, however, the knowledge distributed thanks to the internet and collaborative scientific work, allowed us to find a solution to the problem jointly among countries, thus avoiding competition for the resource. Today we have new challenges, such as deepening our link with nature, so that our impact does not mean further deterioration. How will it end? I do not know, as in previous historical moments there are dichotomous positions, however I have faith that we will solve it. Keep enjoying Barcelona, it will be your best years.","title":"Letter for the future"},{"location":"term2/01-Designing%20for%20the%20Next%20Billion%20Seconds/#time-capsule","text":"","title":"Time capsule"},{"location":"term2/02-Remixing%20Materials/","text":"Atlas of Weak Signals \u00b6 Materials research \u00b6 A new material \u00b6 We started the seminar knowling different types of materials and biomaterials.

Now is the most maker stage of the program, it is certainly something challenging for me, at first it did not seem so attractive, but after my experiences doing interventions I have discovered a taste for leaving the theory and move to action. I also believe that what is relevant for my personal objectives is to share the learning I have achieved through the master\u2019s degree with others, not in a unidirectional way, but by devising new workshops and methodologies so that people can also reach the same conclusion but in an autonomous way. During the presentation, we had an introduction about technology and how we interact with it. My studies in engineering have allowed me to be super close to the problems associated with understanding technology, so part of the reflections we had during the presentation made a lot of sense to me. At the same time, despite the danger of new digital tools, I think they are a great contribution to the work of the person. From a social point of view, and away from the master, I think we have to manage to channel these changes in the various areas of impact, such as labor, educational and productive. In this dimension, design has a lot to do and maker culture has even more to do, since it can reduce the gap through tools that are easier to understand. First challenge The first challenge was to operate a speaker through arduino. We had done this before with my group, so it didn\u2019t have to be that difficult. I managed to get it to operate with extremely basic connections, thanks to a youtube tutorial, however the sounds were quite limited. I felt provoked by the different tunes my classmates were making, so I asked them to help me do it too. The easiest was with Arduino Maker Uno, a different board that Wen had that she had used in a workshop with kids years ago. I followed the tutorial Marielle shared with me and we got to work. There was a very complete list of songs, which made the exercise quite entertaining. It reminded me of the ringtones I had on my cell phone when I was in elementary school. I wanted to find more modern songs so maybe I could go viral on my social networks, however I didn\u2019t find anything, the most updated was an Ed Sheeran song that we found with Wen and Jime, but the melody wasn\u2019t that similar either. Video Week 1 - Class 2 - Parameterization \u00b6 This class reminded me a bit of what I learned in engineering, it was horrible flashbacks to Calculus 2 class, there I learned about graph and formula based parameterization, vectorization and linear algebra. I think because of this I in general it is easy to assimilate how the different tools work. It was funny that my answer to Edu\u2019s exercise of parameterizing a croissant was a wolfram alpha function, where it is parameterized through two functions and limiting their solution space, through functions. I think that the most striking and important part of the learning is how all that abstract and complex content that I learned in engineering, now could make sense, since what I parameterize can be made real through 3D printers. I am not unaware of the learning I had in engineering, however many times the exercises were not very applied and far from what I might ever need. With FabAcademy at least I can focus on learning while still doing things that are useful for my master\u2019s work. My croissant Parameterization exercise \u00b6 As part of the work, we have to try different tools and understand how they work. As part of the exercise I reviewed the different tools that we saw on the class: grasshopper, fusion, opencads, fusion 360, blender and stable diffusion. I found the concept of Generative Design very interesting, so I wanted to try Fusion360. All the tools were new to me, so any that I wanted would be a considerable time investment. I found out that my undergraduate university has an agreement with Fusion360, so I chose that software and started learning with this tutorial. Then, I searched the internet for available renders created by other people, I was impressed by the large number of renders of weapons, it is worrying the fanaticism of some people for this type of devices that seek to generate harm to other people. Creating cones Idea of the work and initial hypothesis: after my interventions in schools, I would like to use what I learned in fablab to design a game in which children can improve their literacy on issues of environmental awareness and protection, as well as develop their leadership as activists in their environments. Creative process: The first thing I did was to look for a rendering for the game, our idea is to make a game similar to \u201cLudo\u201d, the sketch I found was quite similar. My challenge was to design some of the game pieces. One of the findings of our workshop with the Sant Andreu School in Badalona, was the concern of the children about the trees in Barcelona, mainly because there are not many according to their point of view. For this reason one of the cards will be trees. I started by creating cones to represent each level of the tree, then I duplicated them and resized them to simulate a cone. Finally I made the trunk and a base. It seems simple, but it was not, however it is to be expected, whenever you start using a new tool, you have a time of assimilation, which is basically an investment of time. Creating cones Duplicate cones and sizes changed Tree without base Final tree Reflection about the process: - There is a lot of material available on the internet to learn autonomously. Tutorials are the best way to learn and it is an easy way to do it. - At the beginning it was difficult, but then it became more and more intuitive. I need a mouse, it is impossible to work with the mousepad of the mac. - There is a tremendous potential that can make my life easier, mainly because I don\u2019t like to work with physical tools, so designing through this way and then printing is something much more comfortable for me. Week 1 - Class 3 - Cutting on a laser machine \u00b6 Cutting on a laser machine and 3D printing are some of the most useful things in recent times. During college some friends of mine started selling different objects made with pieces made on a laser cutter: lamps, key chains and furniture. As part of the activity we had to use the laser cutting machine. Following our idea, my goal was to cut with the machine a figure of the possible game. The first thing I did was to consult in different repositories where I could find a tree vector and I found one that was quite useful for me, which simulated a Christmas tree. After learning well how the cutter works and finding out with my colleagues, I prepared the files to cut. tree in laser cutter I had everything ready to cut on Thursday, however I had to leave because I had a prior commitment. I scheduled a time to use the cutter on Tuesday. Week 1 - Class 4 - Input and output \u00b6 I think that human-machine interaction is one of the most interesting things we can learn in the master. As we learned in the seminar, there are different types of sensors. I was very interested in the ones that were associated with measurements of environmental elements. At the beginning I was very interested in what was being done with SmartCitizen, I wanted to use that technology in my project, but it could be very difficult, and probably I will need more time to do this, and with the time in class, tasks and personal work, it will be impossible. I was very interested in the monitoring of queality of air, because in my country, Chile, this is a huge problem. For my project, I think that sensors can help to guide the activities I want to do with the children, or generate visualizations that allow to understand first conclusions and trends. The challenge was to make a telegraph with arduino. I made the whole attempt, however, until Thursday I only managed to activate the lights with the button. It always happens to me with Arduino, that the simplest steps end up being very complex, generally for not following the instructions correctly. Everything related to electronics is a challenge, however I am very aware of how useful it can be for my project. Then Toni provided me with his code and arduino to test it on my computer and try to move forward, however my changes only made me go backwards in the progress. tree in laser cutter Challenge \u00b6 Working with Jimena and Wen is very comfortable, in general it is very easy for us to make decisions, which facilitates our work and allows us to move forward more quickly. The idea was different from the one I proposed, and we did not make a game, but a perception map, as a way to stimulate debate, the generation of new ideas and literacy on issues of climate crisis, mental health and gender equality. I think our idea is quite useful for facilitating discussion processes and team building activities. Sharing points of view helps us to make our own blind spots visible. Our structure based on: discussion of idea, planning and then execution was very useful to make the experience not so traumatic. Thanks to this activity I remembered how to use the laser cutter and imagine future uses for personal projects. Work with rhino designing the emoji tokens and cutting them on the machine. In the first iteration with cardboard Wen took the lead since she already knew how to use it and the second day with wood, Jimena and I made the cuts. my team The biggest difficulty was in the electronics, I was in charge of the board lights and because of a bad connection inside the board, our progress was stopped for a few hours. Much of the FabLab team was helping me with the problem, my led would light up when any object approached it, something much more complex than we needed. Then the problem was to connect all the pins to the arduino, the positive thing is that we were able to correct it fast. In the next steps I would like to involve more technology, I saw in Clodi and Mari\u2019s project the use of an application that they created and people could interact with their device and at the same time with cell phones, I think that is a tremendous development opportunity for us. my team Another improvement is to use sensors and lights to better guide the activity, for example as more people have an opinion the square could be illuminated or instead of having LEDs we could have a series of lights that change color according to the gradient. Things I learned: - Even though you are trying something very simple with Arduino, this can get complicated. You have to be neat and follow each step. - Using rhino and laser cutting. How to regulate each of the parameters to avoid burning the wood and affecting the aesthetics of our project. - The importance of documenting the process permanently and not at the end of the process. I learned this from Wen and Jime, both have this work methodology, which makes it much easier, since we can consult the steps and not lose focus on what we are doing.
