I investigated the relationship between quality of life and travel time from home to work.

I represented that with different tubes (printed in 3D), each one represented a neighborhood, and they moved towards the center at different speeds (with an engine and Arduino). The tubes representing the rich neighborhoods were faster than those representing the poor. IMAGEN Roles of prototyping: new opportunities \u00b6 My fight is to connect different perspectives, points of view or expectations, and create a new system, product or service.

Along with that, the classes include field visits, where we could learn about the work in this matter from the space where it is created. In addition, each class had a series of exercises and experiments that helped us to apply and, and know physically the different theoretical learnings that we had. For me, the experiment of making our own bioplastics was key to my learning. We carried out all the experiments in the same group and in general, at the beginning it was difficult for us to understand what to do and how to do it, mainly because all of us years ago were not familiar with this type of activity and we were not able to understand what we were doing. Over time we learned that our best strategy was to stop and think before we started mixing and executing actions. That\u2019s what we did with the bioplastic preparation, which worked quite well for us as it was the right consistency and met the key criteria we needed to achieve. It was a pleasant experience of teamwork and execution. On the other hand, the experiment itself seemed very interesting to me, since it allowed us to verify live that we are capable of making bioplastic, in a simple and methodical way, which opens the possibility for our projects to consider this variant, without seeing it as a extreme difficulty or that makes our project much more complicated. At the same time, it brings us closer to a production that is friendlier to the environment, since since they are not derived from petroleum (like plastics), they can biodegrade more easily. Cultured meat phenomenon \u00b6 The food crisis, animal-borne diseases, the climate crisis and increased environmental conscience have led scientists to improve food productivity and yields using technology. In this way, different ventures focused on this market have been born, which seek through science to generate meat for consumption without sacrificing any animal. There are two types, one that is carried out through cell culture of animal cells and another that seeks to replicate animal proteins through other foods, such as mushrooms, legumes and other vegetables. Figure 1 outlines in a simple way the process of cultured meat, which, as established by Faustman (2020), is not technically meat, since it corresponds to cultured muscle tissue, since it derives from muscle cells, and corresponds to a post-mortem biochemical product. . On the other hand, genetic engineering has made it possible to create completely acellular meats, and therefore, 100% free of any animal origin, since it uses different protein architectures, which, when modified, allow animal replication. The challenge of both technologies, as established by the news and the different papers, is to replicate the characteristics of the meat, managing to replicate the taste, smell, colors and textures in the most perfect way possible. To achieve this, a high investment in technology is required and also, as stable XX, more legislation is required to establish regulatory frameworks to stimulate this type of research. Reflection associated with the course \u00b6 This case reflects part of what the course tried to convey to us, since they taught us about the structure of proteins and how they could be modified through genetic and scientific processes, and thus be more sustainable and efficient with the use of the resources. In turn, this allows linking a vision regarding the transformation that we would like to carry out in the world, together with scientific development, moving the barrier of knowledge hand in hand with a positive impact. Now, a criticism that can be made is that this is a reactive solution, since it does not seek to change eating habits, but instead seeks to replace products. Probably, as is the case now, this type of cultured meat will also be inaccessible to people with fewer resources and will even cause people to consume even more meat, without considering dietary limitations or the benefit of these actions.

My personal work experience and the reality of my country have guided my motivation. I would like to change the way I recognized and measured the impacts of industry on environment and the lives of communities near such business. Change is not easy, because many times we must change our habits, and our quality of life, because we have to get out of our comfort zone. What is the cost of changing our habits? How do I feel when I have to change my routine because it would be better for the community, but maybe worse for me, because it is not my preference? When I arrived in BCN, I wanted to lead a more active life. I said to myself \u201cI\u2019m going to go to the university by bike\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m going to walk all the time\u201d, but the reality is very different. Actually when I have to go to the university or to another neighborhood I always use public transport, I have rarely walked, for me using public transport is more comfortable and it is my preference. \u2022 What did you make? Why did it matter? With all of this thing on mind I challenged me walking each time I should to go to any place. It\u2019s my way to be more close to \u201cmy new me\u201d and a way to analyze how I feeling when I should changing my routine and take a different decision that is better for me. My goal was registered my feelings after a long walk, my time travel and distance, and then compare this with my previous situation. \u2022 What happens when you involve yourself? When I started the challenge, not only did it change the way I moved from one place to another, but also part of my day: my lunch schedule, my available time to relax, my time to meet with friends. All of that influenced my mood, for example when I wanted to get home as fast as possible, I could not take the most efficient route because I could only walking. This allowed me to realize that decisions can actually influence a lot other dimensions, so you have to be as aware as possible of the consequences that a decision (like just walking) can have. \u2022 What happens when you use yourself as an instrument? I started to become aware of things that I didn\u2019t realize before when I was walking. Two important elements I became aware of is how my feeling of security varied depending on the time of day and the neighborhood I was in. Similarly, one day when I went jogging in my neighborhood I noticed the low female presence and questioned how it could be a different experience to do sports in public for a woman than for a man, and the need to design with a gender perspective, especially in Latin American countries. This kind of things has probably always happened, but I had not even seen it. \u2022 Did anything change about your way of working? The biggest change was associated with being constantly critical about what I am doing. Many times I just execute tasks and try to fulfill the expected objectives, but I do a very basic exercise of assimilation of learning. Many times learning is not merely theoretical, but has to do with sensitivities, emotional experiences, urban experiences, among others. Recording and monitoring is a relevant element to recognize opportunities and spaces for action or changes. \u2022 What does it mean for your future work? For my future work the creation process is also a learning process, so it is relevant not only to pay attention to the final product, but also to everything that was involved, including my personal experience, which can be an input for future improvements. On the other hand, I realized through the exercise the need to consider profiles different from mine in order to have a correct appreciation of the problem, because my experience walking around of Barcelona can be very different from a woman\u2019s or a child\u2019s, so testing is a very important part of the process. \u2022 After seeing the videos of your design space collective, how does it change your understanding of it, present new opportunities or inspire new possibilities for collaboration? The work of my classmates was inspiring mainly because they all connected it with a personal motivation, which helps me to nourish myself with respect to different ideas and concepts to which I did not have access before. Mainly the challenges associated with the recording of feelings I found extremely important and revealing, and they also used instruments that were unknown to me until now, which expanded my tools to develop my master\u2019s project. On the other hand, some of them were extremely innovative in their recordings, both in what they measured and how they did it. This was inspiring, because it was a departure from the measurements traditionally made in my discipline, such as those I made of travel time and distance traveled.","title":"Living With Your Own Ideas"},{"location":"term1/04-Living%20With%20Your%20Own%20Ideas/#living-with-your-own-ideas","text":"","title":"Living with your own ideas"},{"location":"term1/04-Living%20With%20Your%20Own%20Ideas/#experience","text":"My fight is to connect different point of views and design new ways of understanding problems and solutions, as a strategy to build strong societies and better \u201ccommon worlds\u201d.

My goal was registered my feelings after a long walk, my time travel and distance, and then compare this with my previous situation. \u2022 What happens when you involve yourself? When I started the challenge, not only did it change the way I moved from one place to another, but also part of my day: my lunch schedule, my available time to relax, my time to meet with friends. All of that influenced my mood, for example when I wanted to get home as fast as possible, I could not take the most efficient route because I could only walking. This allowed me to realize that decisions can actually influence a lot other dimensions, so you have to be as aware as possible of the consequences that a decision (like just walking) can have. \u2022 What happens when you use yourself as an instrument? I started to become aware of things that I didn\u2019t realize before when I was walking. Two important elements I became aware of is how my feeling of security varied depending on the time of day and the neighborhood I was in. Similarly, one day when I went jogging in my neighborhood I noticed the low female presence and questioned how it could be a different experience to do sports in public for a woman than for a man, and the need to design with a gender perspective, especially in Latin American countries. This kind of things has probably always happened, but I had not even seen it. \u2022 Did anything change about your way of working? The biggest change was associated with being constantly critical about what I am doing. Many times I just execute tasks and try to fulfill the expected objectives, but I do a very basic exercise of assimilation of learning. Many times learning is not merely theoretical, but has to do with sensitivities, emotional experiences, urban experiences, among others. Recording and monitoring is a relevant element to recognize opportunities and spaces for action or changes. \u2022 What does it mean for your future work? For my future work the creation process is also a learning process, so it is relevant not only to pay attention to the final product, but also to everything that was involved, including my personal experience, which can be an input for future improvements. On the other hand, I realized through the exercise the need to consider profiles different from mine in order to have a correct appreciation of the problem, because my experience walking around of Barcelona can be very different from a woman\u2019s or a child\u2019s, so testing is a very important part of the process. \u2022 After seeing the videos of your design space collective, how does it change your understanding of it, present new opportunities or inspire new possibilities for collaboration? The work of my classmates was inspiring mainly because they all connected it with a personal motivation, which helps me to nourish myself with respect to different ideas and concepts to which I did not have access before. Mainly the challenges associated with the recording of feelings I found extremely important and revealing, and they also used instruments that were unknown to me until now, which expanded my tools to develop my master\u2019s project. On the other hand, some of them were extremely innovative in their recordings, both in what they measured and how they did it. This was inspiring, because it was a departure from the measurements traditionally made in my discipline, such as those I made of travel time and distance traveled.","title":"Experience"}]}
