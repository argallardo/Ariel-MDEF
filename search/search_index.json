My reasons are connected with my previous experience as consultant of community relationship. In that role, I worked on a project where we needed to design a relationship between a community and a mining company. The problem was that the company produced a lot of dust, and that created a yellow cloud during the morning. This generates two different positions, in one hand the community claimed for the contamination, on the other hand, the company argues that the level of contamination is lower than the standard allowed by the government. What can we do with it? My fight is to connect different points of view and create realities that consider all dimensions of the problem, not only one side, not just arguments that benefit us. In Chile (my country), and a big part of latin america, sacrifice areas are a common problem. A lot of communities have been permanently impaired by heavy environmental alterations, and most commonly exist in low-income and minority communities. How can we change the way we understand territorial coexistence? How can we have more control over industries? Opportunities \u00b6 The last few days I have been trying to think about different proxies to this problem, because I want to explore other topics. In my four years as consultant, impacts of the industry on communities and their environments have been common issues for me. Atlas of Weak Signals was a very important activity to think of new things, because that way I can make more creative proposals. In my first iteration with the cards, I had to connect \u201cCarbon Neutral Lifestyle\u201d, \u201cPick your own passport\u201d, \u201cComputational thinking\u201d, \u201cSustainable leisure\u201d and \u201cRegenerative tourism\u201d. After thinking a bit about each concept, I envisioned a green passport for tourists that measures the amount of pollution during your trip. Cool. If we follow the same \u201ccurrent of thought\u201d perhaps we can create a new passport to companies, different from the institutional environmental indicators, which consider the approval of the communities. Passing state requirements is minimal, considering community voice is mandatory. \u201cMonitoreo Ciudadano\u201d, is a challenge of governance and how communities, companies, and governments understand territorial coexistence. I\u2019m probably conceptualizing the problem wrong, but it\u2019s a first approximation.
