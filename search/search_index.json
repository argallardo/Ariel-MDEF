For me, she was a very good translator. Personal development plan \u00b6 After sharing my fight and interests with my peers, I created my personal development plan, based on my previous experiences and my learning expectations. Analysis of my development \u00b6 Roles of prototyping: previous experience \u00b6 When I was studying engineering, the most typical prototype I used was Role 1, related to testing different aspects or functions of my projects. In 2017 I was doing the course \u201cResearch, Innovation and Entrepreneurship\u201d at the Faculty of Engineering, and my team and I developed a medical device to help \u201cclaw hands\u201d, a degenerative disease suffered by people with dementia and other types of ailments. It was a very extensive prototyping process, because we tested the dimensions, the materials, the technology and the physical exercises. IMAGEN Also, when I was in the \u201cVisual Thinking\u201d course, we were challenged to represent our conclusions after researching with public data. Role number 3. I investigated the relationship between quality of life and travel time from home to work. In that project I tried to represent inequality in Chile, because people who live in poor neighborhoods take longer time to go to work, while people who live in rich neighborhoods take a minimum time to go to work. I represented that with different tubes (printed in 3D), each one represented a neighborhood, and they moved towards the center at different speeds (with an engine and Arduino). The tubes representing the rich neighborhoods were faster than those representing the poor. IMAGEN Roles of prototyping: new opportunities \u00b6 My fight is to connect different perspectives, points of view or expectations, and create a new system, product or service. With this objective, role number 4, the prototyping process as a consultation vehicle, is very important, because if I want a good creation I have to worry about the process, and not just the final product/service. Legitimacy depends on how we build. I believe that this sentence can be explained with the same arguments used by the robotic arm in the text Prototypes and Prototyping in Design Research. \u201cBut the robotic arm example is also one where the contribution to knowledge can only occur through an iterative prototyping process: we cannot discover the principles or requirements for building a robotic arm without thinking about design possibilities. , propose, build, test, reconfigure, etc., an artifact that iteratively clarifies our understanding of this particular design space.\u201d Desired \u00b6 With this in mind, I would like to make an open and permanent iterative process, which is solid in the technical aspects, but which is open to the construction of the product/service from collective intelligence. Legitimacy is built with clear and inclusive criteria, where the participation of both, scientific and profane knowledge, prevails and in a context willing to redefine concepts, practices and norms, in order to generate new agreements. In this sense, the process is a very relevant part of the construction, so it must be permanently documented, analyzed and criticized. On the other hand, the conclusions obtained through a collective construction are not always correct. The product/service generated must be prototyped to ensure its effectiveness, that it serves for the change that is to be achieved. Therefore, it must be tested empirically, from a qualitative (for example, interviews) and/or quantitative (for example, data recording) aspect.

However, my challenge is to be able to expand those links to new talents, who can deliver new perspectives. I see it as a very good opportunity to take advantage of the knowledge obtained in the Smart Citizen project, since part of my interest is related to participation and citizen sensing.","title":"Design Studio"},{"location":"term1/01-Design%20Studio/#design-studio","text":"","title":"Design Studio"},{"location":"term1/01-Design%20Studio/#my-fight","text":"My fight is to connect different perspectives, points of view or expectations, and create a system, a product or a service.

My reasons are connected with my previous experience as consultant of community relationship. In that role, I worked on a project where we needed to design a relationship between a community and a mining company.

Step by step","title":"Opportunities"},{"location":"term1/03-Bio%20Agri%20Zero/","text":"Bio - Agri Zero \u00b6 Experience \u00b6 For two weeks we were learning about the theoretical bases of biology, along with learning about the planetary point of view, concepts such as the anthropocene, and the relevance of ecology and biodiversity. Along with that, the classes include field visits, where we could learn about the work in this matter from the space where it is created. In addition, each class had a series of exercises and experiments that helped us to apply and, and know physically the different theoretical learnings that we had. For me, the experiment of making our own bioplastics was key to my learning. We carried out all the experiments in the same group and in general, at the beginning it was difficult for us to understand what to do and how to do it, mainly because all of us years ago were not familiar with this type of activity and we were not able to understand what we were doing. Over time we learned that our best strategy was to stop and think before we started mixing and executing actions. That\u2019s what we did with the bioplastic preparation, which worked quite well for us as it was the right consistency and met the key criteria we needed to achieve. It was a pleasant experience of teamwork and execution. On the other hand, the experiment itself seemed very interesting to me, since it allowed us to verify live that we are capable of making bioplastic, in a simple and methodical way, which opens the possibility for our projects to consider this variant, without seeing it as a extreme difficulty or that makes our project much more complicated. At the same time, it brings us closer to a production that is friendlier to the environment, since since they are not derived from petroleum (like plastics), they can biodegrade more easily. Cultured meat phenomenon \u00b6 The food crisis, animal-borne diseases, the climate crisis and increased environmental conscience have led scientists to improve food productivity and yields using technology. In this way, different ventures focused on this market have been born, which seek through science to generate meat for consumption without sacrificing any animal. There are two types, one that is carried out through cell culture of animal cells and another that seeks to replicate animal proteins through other foods, such as mushrooms, legumes and other vegetables. Figure 1 outlines in a simple way the process of cultured meat, which, as established by Faustman (2020), is not technically meat, since it corresponds to cultured muscle tissue, since it derives from muscle cells, and corresponds to a post-mortem biochemical product. . On the other hand, genetic engineering has made it possible to create completely acellular meats, and therefore, 100% free of any animal origin, since it uses different protein architectures, which, when modified, allow animal replication. The challenge of both technologies, as established by the news and the different papers, is to replicate the characteristics of the meat, managing to replicate the taste, smell, colors and textures in the most perfect way possible. To achieve this, a high investment in technology is required and also, as stable XX, more legislation is required to establish regulatory frameworks to stimulate this type of research. Reflection associated with the course \u00b6 This case reflects part of what the course tried to convey to us, since they taught us about the structure of proteins and how they could be modified through genetic and scientific processes, and thus be more sustainable and efficient with the use of the resources. In turn, this allows linking a vision regarding the transformation that we would like to carry out in the world, together with scientific development, moving the barrier of knowledge hand in hand with a positive impact. Now, a criticism that can be made is that this is a reactive solution, since it does not seek to change eating habits, but instead seeks to replace products. Probably, as is the case now, this type of cultured meat will also be inaccessible to people with fewer resources and will even cause people to consume even more meat, without considering dietary limitations or the benefit of these actions.
