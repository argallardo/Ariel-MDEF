## Reflections

When I started at MDEF, I wanted to work with citizen detection and create a kind of citizen monitoring that would give power to the voice of the community, because monitoring would be part of the key performance indicators of companies and authorities. In simple words, companies will be ok with the law only if citizen monitoring says so.  However, after MDEF seminars I realized that it was a problem because I decided it, but nobody in Barcelona told me it was a problem for them. That's why I decided to change my perspective and work in a different way.

Thanks to the exercise of creating collective design spaces with other classmates I started working with Jimena and Wen. From the beginning we shared a common motivation, to create something from a child's perspective, because the future will be theirs. So we designed a workshop in which children have to imagine the future in different dimensions: climate change and gender equality. I am interested in climate change and Jimena in gender equality.

I want my new project to have participation from the beginning. So I have 3 main steps:

1. Data collection: I will go to a specific community of children and ask them how they imagine the future of nature.
2. Analyze and define the theme: With the data I will define the theme, for example: animal-human relations, air pollution, public green spaces, etc.
3. Design a new workshop on the specific topic: trying to find a product or experience to transform reality and be closer to the ideal future.

With this in mind, we talked to Xavi from Fablab, and he put us in contact with a school in Badalona. We designed a proposal for our 1st intervention:
