# Prototyping for Design

## Week 1 - Class 1 - Introduction and Arduino exercise

In today's class, we had an introduction of what we are going to face during the next weeks. Now is the most maker stage of the program, it is certainly something challenging for me, at first it did not seem so attractive, but after my experiences doing interventions I have discovered a taste for leaving the theory and move to action. I also believe that what is relevant for my personal objectives is to share the learning I have achieved through the master's degree with others, not in a unidirectional way, but by devising new workshops and methodologies so that people can also reach the same conclusion but in an autonomous way.  

During the presentation, we had an introduction about technology and how we interact with it. My studies in engineering have allowed me to be super close to the problems associated with understanding technology, so part of the reflections we had during the presentation made a lot of sense to me. At the same time, despite the danger of new digital tools, I think they are a great contribution to the work of the person. From a social point of view, and away from the master, I think we have to manage to channel these changes in the various areas of impact, such as labor, educational and productive. In this dimension, design has a lot to do and maker culture has even more to do, since it can reduce the gap through tools that are easier to understand.

# First challenge

The first challenge was to operate a speaker through arduino. We had done this before with my group, so it didn't have to be that difficult. I managed to get it to operate with extremely basic connections, thanks to a youtube tutorial, however the sounds were quite limited. I felt provoked by the different tunes my classmates were making, so I asked them to help me do it too.

The easiest was with Arduino Maker Uno, a different board that Wen had that she had used in a workshop with kids years ago. I followed the tutorial Marielle shared with me and we got to work.

There was a very complete list of songs, which made the exercise quite entertaining. It reminded me of the ringtones I had on my cell phone when I was in elementary school. I wanted to find more modern songs so maybe I could go viral on my social networks, however I didn't find anything, the most updated was an Ed Sheeran song that we found with Wen and Jime, but the melody wasn't that similar either.

## Week 1 - Class 2 - Parameterization

This class reminded me a bit of what I learned in engineering, it was horrible flashbacks to Calculus 2 class, there I learned about graph and formula based parameterization, vectorization and linear algebra. I think because of this I in general it is easy to assimilate how the different tools work.

It was funny that my answer to Edu's exercise of parameterizing a croissant was a wolfram alpha function, where it is parameterized through two functions and limiting their solution space, through functions. I think that the most striking and important part of the learning is how all that abstract and complex content that I learned in engineering, now could make sense, since what I parameterize can be made real through 3D printers. I am not unaware of the learning I had in engineering, however many times the exercises were not very applied and far from what I might ever need. With FabAcademy at least I can focus on learning while still doing things that are useful for my master's work.

As part of the assignment, we have to try out different tools to understand how they work. As part of the exercise I tried
