# A new material

We started the seminar knowling different types of materials and biomaterials. I think that design for emergent futures considers the creation of materials from waste and with characteristics as compostable, degradable and friendly with the environment. This seminar allowed me to realize that working with different materials is possible, sometimes it’s not easy, but with help of your classmates and teachers you can do this.

My group was Jimena, Wen and I. We are working together in the interventions, and for that reason it was easier to work together. We decided to work with orange peels because we were curious about the amount of oranges that we can see around Barcelona. We discussed the machines of orange juice in Mercadona, and the waste that it generates.

With this in mind, we thought of “designing” a plant recipient with the oranges, compostable and biodegradable. Our first difficulty was the recipe. We didn’t know how we could build this. For that reason, we used Chat GPT in a way to explore the tool and do things in a different way. The chat gave us a different alternatives, and part of our process and research is in our presentation:

This exercise was important for me, because I realized that work with materials is easy, and you just have to explore and try. Linking this with my project is important because I can materialize my learnings. In that way, I think that it is relevant and can help kids to discover the same. It could help them to develop their skill to give another use to the materials that they have access to in the future.

On the other hand, other important feedback from the teachers was that we can use different ingredients for different plants, and think from the plant perspective. For example, some plants could need coffee, or a different subtract, and that way through our recipient we can help them. It’s a good next step for our product.
