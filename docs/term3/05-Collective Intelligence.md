# Collective Intelligence

During this course we were challenged to imagine spaces in which NFT or blockchain could help us in our projects. For me it was interesting to learn how the logic of NFT works since the world of design and art is extremely vulnerable to imitation in the face of technology. I have always found it amazing how solutions can be generated to problems that I had never imagined. I think we live in a world where anything can be made to work.

We also learned more in detail about blockchain (recognizing that NFT are part of blockchain as well) and its implications to different industries. Personally I have an interest in public policy, so it was very interesting for me to know references and search on the internet how the most developed countries in this area were including blockchain as part of their strategies.

During the second session we continued interacting with our Tezos portfolio, which I am very grateful for as I consider that practice is a much simpler and effective way to learn, especially more complex or abstract things like the ones we dealt with in the course. At the beginning I failed a bit, as I had no money in my wallet, Wen transferred me, but I was left with less money, so we lost a bit of time on that.

Finally, during the workshop on Friday we were asked to think of applications of the different tools in our personal projects. Our proposal:
