## Alternative Presents

Society has evolved to recognize the inherent worth and intelligence of children, and as a result, children are given a much greater voice in the world. No longer are they infantilized and treated as though they are incapable of contributing meaningfully to society.

From a young age, children are taught critical thinking skills and encouraged to voice their opinions and ideas. They are given a platform to share their thoughts and are actively engaged in decision-making processes that affect their lives. Schools are more collaborative, with teachers and students working together as equal partners in the learning process.
Children are able to make important contributions to society. They bring fresh perspectives and innovative ideas to the table, and their insights are valued and respected. They are not treated as mere recipients of information, but as active agents in shaping the world around them.

I want to be a professional who designed and created spaces, platforms and services that can collect this point of view, and empower the children.
