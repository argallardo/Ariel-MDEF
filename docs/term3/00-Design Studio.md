# Design Studio

## Alternative Presents

Society has evolved to recognize the inherent worth and intelligence of children, and as a result, children are given a much greater voice in the world. No longer are they infantilized and treated as though they are incapable of contributing meaningfully to society.

From a young age, children are taught critical thinking skills and encouraged to voice their opinions and ideas. They are given a platform to share their thoughts and are actively engaged in decision-making processes that affect their lives. Schools are more collaborative, with teachers and students working together as equal partners in the learning process.
Children are able to make important contributions to society. They bring fresh perspectives and innovative ideas to the table, and their insights are valued and respected. They are not treated as mere recipients of information, but as active agents in shaping the world around them.

I want to be a professional who designed and created spaces, platforms and services that can collect this point of view, and empower the children.

## Scalability roadmap for decentralization

Our next steps in the project are to test our device in different schools and contexts, so that we can adjust different details. First of all we want to make our perception board lighter and more transportable, so that it will be an easy tool to apply in different contexts. At the same time we have the idea of designing an open source version, so that it can be available to anyone.

After the final interventions of the MDEF Fest we want to apply to different funds and fairs to show our work. We have in mind Vienna Design Week, Dutch Design Week, and the Dubai competition. For that, we have designed different products, which we have been nurturing with the different tasks we have had throughout the Master.

Finally, we have been reviewing the business models of similar projects, as a way to scale our device. However, as a group we have also focused on looking for job opportunities that allow us to leverage our interests and knowledge acquired in the master.


## The 5W’s of scaling

As a group we constructed the following 5W's:

Why?
Create a distributed network of teachers and/or designers interested in implementing our Perception Board, collage workshop or other education tools to help children design future solutions for the world’s most pressing problems. To reimagine future tools of education creating alternative ways for children and teenagers to talk about difficult topics and improve the dialogue skills in the society

What?
Digital assets and databases including all the materials, documentation and files to set up or run workshops with schools in Barcelona and elsewhere. Perception Board and Tools, both physical and digital

Who?
Network of private and public schools in Barcelona, teachers working on climate change and innovation, designers collaborating with children

Where?
Schools in Barcelona (pilot in Sant Andreu in Baladona), schools in Latin America and/or Asia, after school spaces / parks / public spaces. Could also happen online.

When?
In the short term, activities in school in Badalona, long term activities are replicated by external participants. Potentials to share our projects on a wider platform.
