# Design Ethics

This seminar helped me to realize my blind spots when I'm designing. Previously I worked in a crisis and controversy consulting firm, where our task was to address wicked problems faced by public and private companies and foundations. There we had the challenge of conceptualizing the problems, in a way that we could understand them and propose a point of view to manage them. With the discussion we had about weapons, I was able to realize the different nuances that these problems have, and I also thought about the problem that Chile (my country) is facing due to the crisis of violence that we are experiencing.

This seminar made me aware of how we overlook what technology encourages us to do and how we also sometimes design so that people have less autonomy and decision-making power. Personally, one of my core values is to empower people, democratize information and encourage diversity in all its forms, so designing the way many new technologies are doing it goes totally against my purpose as a person.
