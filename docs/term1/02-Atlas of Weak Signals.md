# Atlas of Weak Signals

My fight is to connect different perspectives, points of view or expectations, and create a system, a product or a service. It is the ability to translate two worlds, and create a new one.

She was Marie Reiche, a German archaeologist who traveled through South America with a ladder, because she realized that when you saw stones on the ground they meant nothing, but as you climbed the stairs the same stones formed a bird, a flower, a system. For me, she was a very good translator.
