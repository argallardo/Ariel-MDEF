# Extendend Intelligence

# Experience

I had worked on this kind of thing before, not from an applied perspective, but in a strategic way. This course has been a complete refresher on these issues. Many of the companies I have advised before have faced dilemmas similar to what we learned in the course. Increasingly the ethics behind new technologies and algorithms are a relevant point to study. I remember some new devices for shopping malls that could recognize people's faces and clothing styles, and in that way the store could plan its supply chain. In a nutshell, the controversy was: poor and rich dressed differently. If stores repeat this pattern, is it a way of reproducing stereotypes?

The first week allowed me to understand what is going on behind AI and new technologies. It made me question how many devices hide deep dilemmas, which we need to talk about first. For the assignment we were challenged to think of a device of the future, we iterated on different alternatives, but we always encountered ethical issues, it was very difficult, because we had to be creative even though we could recognize that we were working on something that might be unethical.

After our journey trying to define our idea, we chose a device that could detect sexist behavior in nightclubs, and if the device detects a dangerous situation, it will change the music, a way to control the environment. It could be questionable, because it didn't face the real problem, but it was still a positive action.  

When we were working on it, for me it was very encouraging to see that a lot of people are working on detecting sexism around the world. In many of the datasets we were able to find there were many people collaborating in their construction. Also, it was surprising to me how easy it was to build a dataset and how powerful these kinds of tools can be. It opened my eyes to consider having my project based on these tools. My vacation challenge is to investigate what exists and how I might use it. My first step is to set up a meeting with Pau.
