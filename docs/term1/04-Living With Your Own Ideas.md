# Living with your own ideas

# Experience

![](../images/baz.jpg)

My fight is to connect different point of views and design new ways of understanding problems and solutions, as a strategy to build strong societies and better "common worlds".

My personal work experience and the reality of my country have guided my motivation. I would like to change the way I recognized and measured the impacts of industry on environment and the lives of communities near such business.

Change is not easy, because many times we must change our habits, and our quality of life, because we must get out of our comfort zone.

What is the cost of changing our habits? What am I feeling that I should change my routine because it would be better for the community, but maybe worse for me, because it is not my preference?

When I came to BCN, I wanted a more active life. I told myself "I'm going to go to the university by bike" or "I'm going to walk all the time", but the reality is very different. Actually when I have to go to the university or to another neighborhood I always use public transport, I have rarely walked, for my use public transport is more comfortable and it is my preference.
